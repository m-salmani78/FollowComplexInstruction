{"prompt": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract.

For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects. Don't forget to include the keywords VarMisuse.

These codes are widely used for various purposes, including representing countries in internet domains (country code top-level domains or ccTLDs), in statistical data, and in international trade documentation. They provide a concise and standardized way to identify countries, minimizing ambiguity and facilitating data exchange across different systems and organizations. The codes are assigned by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency.\n\n***\n\nThe assignment of these two-letter codes isn't based on a country's name directly, but rather on historical and linguistic considerations. For example, the United States is represented by \"US,\" Germany by \"DE\" (from Deutsch), and Japan by \"JP.\" Some codes are retained even if a country changes its name or undergoes political restructuring, ensuring continuity in data and systems. It's important to note that these codes are distinct from ISO 3166-1 numeric codes (three-digit codes) and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (three-letter codes), although all serve the same fundamental purpose of country identification.\n\n***\n\nUsing ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes offers several advantages. Their brevity makes them efficient for data storage and transmission. Their standardization ensures interoperability between different systems and applications. Furthermore, the codes are relatively stable, reducing the need for frequent updates. While not universally mandated, they are a de facto standard in many fields, contributing to greater accuracy and efficiency in international communication and data management."}

{"prompt": "In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. \ninput : Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is characterized by accumulation of a surfactant-like substance in alveolar spaces and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs. Please include at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]. The response should have 3 sections, with each section marked with Section X. Make sure your reply is in English and all capital letters.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both.

{"prompt": "In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows.
