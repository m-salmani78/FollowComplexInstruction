He had tried adding more of the flower, but the elixir became *too potent, causing unsettling side effects – vivid hallucinations and temporary shifts in perception*. He realized he needed to find a way to control the concentration of the flower in his potion. “Perhaps,” he mused, “the key lies in understanding the flow of the elixir itself, the way it moves through the body.” He decided to test his theory by adding a tiny drop of the elixir to a drop of water. He watched as the water absorbed the elixir, and the water itself seemed to change, becoming slightly more viscous and taking on a faint, ethereal glow. “This is it,” Mr. Finch exclaimed, “the elixir is not simply absorbed, it flows. It moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, just like diffusion!” He realized that he could use this principle to control the potency of his elixir by carefully adjusting the concentration of the flower within a diluting medium like water. He began to experiment with different ratios, creating a series of increasingly potent elixirs, each with its own unique flow and effect.

We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

While often pictured for its beautiful beaches, the island also features arid desert-like terrain in its interior, particularly towards the north and east coasts. This contrasts with pockets of more lush, tropical vegetation, especially in areas benefiting from trade winds and some rainfall.\n\nSECTION 4: Tourism and Economy\n\nDue to its small size and appealing climate, Aruba has become a popular tourist destination. It offers pristine beaches, consistently clear and calm waters ideal for water sports, and a vibrant culture influenced by its Dutch, Spanish, and indigenous heritage. The island’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism.\n\nSECTION 5: Further Considerations\n\nAruba’s location outside the hurricane belt contributes to its reliably sunny weather, making it a year-round destination. This, combined with its stable political environment and developed infrastructure, further enhances its appeal to tourists and investors alike.", "constraints": ["Write exactly 4 paragraphs each separated with two new lines answering this instruction.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut. in the response, the word \"unambiguous\" should appear at least 2 times in your response.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs. Please include at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].

", "response": "**Understanding the Spread of Islam**\n\nThe spread of Islam is a complex historical process spanning centuries and continents. It didn't occur through a single, unified campaign but rather through a combination of military conquest, trade, Sufi missionary work, and peaceful conversion. Initial expansion occurred rapidly in the 7th and 8th centuries following the Prophet Muhammad’s death, moving outwards from Arabia into North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), and eastward into Persia and Central Asia. Later phases involved more gradual integration and conversion, particularly in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The appeal of Islam’s message, its relative simplicity, and the socio-political context of the regions it entered all played significant roles.\n\n***\n\n**The Ottoman Empire and the Duration of its Rule**\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, a powerful Islamic state, existed for over six centuries, from around 1299 to 1922. While the empire’s origins were in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), it expanded to control vast territories in Southeastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The longevity of Ottoman rule is remarkable, but it wasn’t a period of constant expansion. There were periods of significant growth, consolidation, stagnation, and decline. The empire reached its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries under rulers like Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\n***\n\n**Religious Groups *Before* Ottoman Rule – A Diverse Landscape**\n\nPrior to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, the regions it would eventually control were home to a diverse array of religious groups. In the Middle East and North Africa, Christianity (various denominations including Orthodox, Coptic, and Nestorian), Judaism, and various indigenous religions were prevalent. In the Balkans, Eastern Orthodox Christianity was dominant. Central Asia featured Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and various Turkic shamanistic beliefs. The Iberian Peninsula had a significant Jewish and Muslim population alongside Christians. This pre-Ottoman period was characterized by religious pluralism, though often with periods of conflict and persecution depending on the ruling power.\n\n***\n\n**Religious Groups *During* Ottoman Rule – The Millet System**\n\nThe Ottoman Empire developed a system known as the *millet* system to govern its diverse religious communities. *Millets* were self-governing religious communities (Orthodox Christians, Armenian Christians, Jews, etc.) that were granted a degree of autonomy in matters of personal law (marriage, divorce, inheritance) and education.

Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation. make sure it contains at least 1 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [name].

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. \ninput : ID elements are short interspersed elements (SINEs) found in high copy number in many rodent genomes. BC1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, is derived from the single copy BC1 RNA gene. The BC1 RNA gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for amplification of ID elements.

It is still commonly used today. Its formulation is still quite similar to what was used in 9 th century China. Black powder is considered a low explosive. It is a mixture that burns quickly, but the resulting shock wave travels at subsonic speeds. The speed at which it burns is dependent on the accessibility of oxygen atoms to the carbon source. In contrast, high explosives like nitroglycerin detonate instead of burning, creating shock waves that are supersonic (faster than the speed of sound). Answer: supersonic Please reply in details, and include exactly 3 paragraphs. Separate the paragraphs with ***. include the letter \"j\" at least 6 times. Put your entire response inside double quotation marks. ", "response": "The core distinction the passage judiciously draws is between the combustion processes of black powder and high explosives like nitroglycerin, directly impacting the speed of energy release and resulting shock waves. Black powder functions as a low explosive, undergoing a comparatively slow burn that generates subsonic shock waves. This slower rate isn’t inherent to the material itself, but rather is governed by the accessibility of oxygen to the carbon source within the powder; the passage explicitly states the burning speed is *dependent* on this accessibility. This implies a more controlled, step-wise combustion where the reaction rate is limited by the supply of an essential reactant – oxygen – rather than an immediate, self-propagating reaction. Just imagine the difference!\n\n***\n\nIn stark contrast, high explosives such as nitroglycerin *detonate*, meaning they undergo a near-instantaneous decomposition releasing a massive amount of energy. This detonation creates shock waves that travel at supersonic speeds. The passage doesn’t detail *why* nitroglycerin detonates rather than burns, but the effect is clearly presented: a rapid, explosive energy release. This is fundamentally different from the gradual combustion of black powder, where the reaction is limited by oxygen availability and proceeds at a slower pace. The phrasing used – “sudden, explosive release of energy” versus “gradual, controlled burn” – effectively highlights this critical difference in the mechanisms. It’s a jarring juxtaposition, isn’t it?\n\n***\n\nTherefore, the passage effectively uses the contrasting combustion mechanisms to explain the differing shock wave speeds. The oxygen-dependent, slower burn of black powder results in subsonic waves, while the rapid, self-contained detonation of nitroglycerin generates supersonic waves. The passage doesn’t simply state these facts, but explains *why* they are different, linking the speed of combustion directly to the availability of oxygen in black powder and implicitly to the inherent instability and energy density of high explosives like nitroglycerin. This focus on the underlying mechanisms is key to understanding the passage’s central argument.

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.  \ninput : SQL: SELECT product_id FROM Product_Suppliers GROUP BY product_id HAVING Count ( * ) > 3 UNION SELECT product_id FROM Product_Suppliers WHERE total_value_purchased < 80000\nFeedback: In step 1 swap product suppliers with order items , in step 3 total amount purchased should be greater than 80000.

At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.

They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world. Why was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants. Single parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth. Fast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets. \n Answer: the effect social and economic changes have on people's eating habits add a postscript starting with P.S.to the end of your response.

Thomas Howell) as six hundred and sixty six gigantic interplanetary robots land on Earth.As the robots are landing, two humanoids arrive, one male and one female (Sinead McCafferty). Both are eventually captured by the military who tries to communicate with them. Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others. Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed.Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention. An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by YF-22s. The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed by laser attack.The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is Skye, also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself. However, after using that, the military officer in charge of the \"mission\" starts to use a Taser on Skye, forcing Myron to intervene and be thrown off the project. He goes AWOL and as he is driving away, he is contacted by Skye telepathically and he returns to rescue her. The effort proves successful and starts a city-wide search for him and Skye.The male also manages to escape as the robots begin a systemic attack on the planet, first with an EMP (which aids in Josh rescuing Skye). It's also discovered that the robots are slowing down the Earth's core and stopping the planet's rotation.An effort is made to destroy one of the robots with a nuclear explosion, sacrificing 9000 inhabitants of a small island. When the bomb goes off, the machine emerges unharmed and Skye feels the pain of the people dying and almost passes out. Josh takes the time to comfort Skye before the military finds them again. Myron and Skye come across a married couple and have to put the wife in the back of a 4x4, as she is in labour. The husband delivers the child but is unaware of a complication until he realizes that his wife has stopped breathing. Myron hands the infant to Skye and tells her that if she wants to know the value of humanity, \"you're staring at it\". Myron and the husband desperately try to revive the wife but are unsuccessful. Myron realizes that the wife is dead and stops applying CPR. Skye, despite her earlier statement that she would not get involved, changes her mind and uses her powers to resurrect the wife.Skye, now convinced of the value of humanity, needs to get to the closest robot to return home and end the invasion. Before they can get to the robot, Skye is shot by the military. Both are taken back to the base where Skye is treated for the injury as the planet's rotation stops and a major global earthquake hits.The commander realizes, finally, that Myron was telling the truth and helps Myron move Skye to a vehicle. As they leave, they are chased by the psychologist, who is convinced that keeping Skye will prevent the robots from attacking further.At the feet of the robot, Myron is shot by the psychologist; the robot, reacting to a perceived threat, vaporizes him. The robot man arrives, sees both Skye and Myron possibly dead and uses his own powers to revive both. Skye, in gratitude, hugs Myron before both the unnamed man and Skye are beamed aboard.

", "response": "**Initial Attempts & Focus on Size**\n\nThe initial attempts focused on establishing a contrast around the *size* of rats. The first pairing (\"RATS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR LARGE SIZE.\" / \"THE RATS WERE LARGE AND AGILE, EASILY NAVIGATING THE MAZE.\") demonstrates this. However, \"large size\" is a relatively weak contrast when followed by descriptions of agility – size doesn't preclude agility. The second pairing (\"RATS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR LARGE SIZE.\" / \"THE RATS WERE LARGE IN NUMBER.\") shifts the focus, but still feels somewhat disconnected. While a rat *can* be large, the core issue isn't typically individual size, but population.\n\n***\n\n**Shifting to Population as the Core Contrast**\n\nRecognizing the weakness of the size-focused approach, the subsequent attempts pivoted to emphasize *number* or *population* of rats. This is a more common and impactful concern when discussing rats. The pairing (\"THE LARGE NUMBER OF RATS IN THE CITY WAS A CONCERN.\" / \"THE LARGE POPULATION OF RATS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE INFESTATION.\") is a significant improvement, as it directly addresses the problem associated with a large rat presence.\n\n***\n\n**Repetition and Lack of Development**\n\nThe repetition of the sentence pair (\"THE LARGE NUMBER OF RATS IN THE CITY WAS A CONCERN.\" / \"THE LARGE NUMBER OF RATS IN THE CITY WAS A CONCERN.\") highlights a key issue: a lack of development of the contrast. While the initial shift to population was positive, simply restating the same idea doesn't demonstrate an understanding of *contrastive* sentence construction. A stronger pairing would explore different *aspects* of the large rat population.\n\n***\n\n**Potential Improvements & Alternative Approaches**\n\nTo better illustrate contrast, future pairings could explore:\n\n*   **Problem vs. Solution:** \"The large number of rats in the city was a concern.\" / \"Implementing a comprehensive pest control program began to reduce the rat population.\"\n*   **Cause vs. Effect:** \"The large number of rats in the city was a concern.\" / \"The unsanitary conditions contributed to the rapid growth of the rat population.\"\n*   **Public Perception vs. Reality:** \"The large number of rats in the city was a concern, fueling public fear.\" / \"Despite the high numbers, most rat encounters do not result in disease transmission.\"\n\n***\n\n**Summary", "constraints": ["Make sure your reply is in English and all capital letters", "Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***", "The word large should appear at least 3 times in the song", "please explicitly add a note starting with P.P.S", "Respond with at least 23 words"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, true, true, true], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_paragraphs": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "large", "frequency": 3}, {"postscript_marker": "P.P.S"}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 23}]}

We'll begin with broader terms and then move towards more specific, yet still hypernymic, options.\n\n***\n\n**1. The Broadest Category: Large Vessel**\n\nThe most encompassing hypernym for \"battleship\" is undoubtedly \"large vessel.\" This term simply denotes a substantial watercraft and successfully categorizes battleships alongside cargo ships, cruise liners, and other sizable marine vehicles. The strength of this hypernym lies in its generality; it’s undeniably true that a battleship *is* a large vessel. However, its breadth also means it lacks specificity.\n\n***\n\n**2. Focusing on Purpose: Warship & Ship of War**\n\nMoving closer to the core function of a battleship, we arrive at \"warship\" and its synonym, \"ship of war.\" These terms immediately signal a vessel designed for military operations. A battleship definitively falls under this category, being a primary offensive unit in naval warfare for a significant period. These are stronger hypernyms than \"large vessel\" because they highlight the *purpose* of the battleship.\n\n***\n\n**3. Emphasizing Armament: Armed Vessel & Combatant Vessel**\n\nFurther refining the categorization, \"armed vessel\" and \"combatant vessel\" are also valid hypernyms. These terms emphasize the battleship’s defining characteristic: its capacity for engaging in combat. \"Combatant vessel\" is arguably more modern and precise, often used in contemporary naval terminology. Both accurately place battleships within a group of vessels specifically equipped for warfare.\n\n***\n\n**4. Contextual Nuance & The \"Best\" Hypernym**\n\nIt’s crucial to understand that the *most appropriate* hypernym isn’t absolute. It’s heavily influenced by the context of the discussion. For instance, when discussing historical naval engagements, \"warship\" might be perfectly sufficient. However, in a modern strategic analysis of naval power, \"combatant vessel\" might be preferred for its greater precision and relevance to current classifications.

We are looking for formal form which is how you would type your queries in a text-based virtual assistant. 2) The words between quotation marks *SHOULD NOT* be translated. We expect you to keep those values intact and include the quotation marks around them as well. 3) The fully capitalized words like DATE_0, or DURATION_0 *SHOULD NOT* be translated. Please keep them as they are in the translations. 4) Please do not localize measurement units like miles to kilometers during your translation. miles should be translated to its equivalent in your language. 6) Note the input is all lowercased except for fully capitalized special placeholders (e.g. NUMBER, DATE, TIME). Please do the same in your translations. \ninput : find a \" mexican \" restaurant with 9 or more stars . In your entire response make sure to use exactly 2 bullet points in markdown format.

Understanding the need for a highly-regarded establishment, I’ve focused on identifying a Mexican restaurant with a substantial rating, specifically 9 or more stars (where applicable, as rating scales vary). The goal is to provide a recommendation that isn’t just popular, but demonstrably excellent based on customer feedback. This requires a careful search across multiple review platforms.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAfter extensive searching, **La Casita Mexicana** in Bell Gardens, California consistently appears with exceptionally high ratings. While a single numerical \"star\" rating isn't always available (some platforms use scales of 5 or 10, or rely on aggregate scores), La Casita Mexicana frequently receives scores equivalent to 9 or higher when converted across different systems. It boasts over 4.5 stars on Yelp with nearly 2,000 reviews, and consistently positive mentions on Google Reviews and TripAdvisor. This indicates a broad consensus of customer satisfaction.\n\n<br><br>\n\nWhat sets La Casita Mexicana apart is not just the quantity of positive reviews, but the *quality* of the feedback. Diners consistently praise the authentic flavors, generous portions, and friendly service. Many reviewers specifically highlight the mole dishes as being exceptional, and the overall atmosphere is described as warm and inviting. It’s a family-owned and operated restaurant, which often translates to a greater level of care and attention to detail in both the food and the customer experience.\n\n<br><br>\n\nTherefore, La Casita Mexicana appears to be a justly highly-rated establishment that fulfills the criteria of a Mexican restaurant with a rating equivalent to 9 or more stars. It’s a place where you can confidently expect a delicious and authentic Mexican meal, backed by a substantial number of positive reviews and a reputation for excellence.

", "response": "<<Deconstructing Avonlea’s Main Street: Identifying the Missing Word>>\n\nContextually, identifying the missing word requires understanding its role within the descriptive passage from L.M. Montgomery’s “Anne of Green Gables.” The sentence focuses on Avonlea Main Street and, crucially, Rachel Lynde’s reaction to its placement within the surrounding natural environment. The significance lies in how the street integrates – or doesn’t – with the idyllic landscape Montgomery establishes as central to the novel’s atmosphere. Knowing the coordinates of the Avonlea Schoolhouse [46.32° N, 63.58° W] helps ground the setting, but the missing word clarifies the street’s immediate relationship to features like the brook and alders.\n\nThe Avonlea Main Street isn’t merely a location; it’s a hub of community life for Anne Shirley and other characters. The detailed description – “hollow fringed with alders and ladies’ eardrops and traversed by a brook” – emphasizes the close proximity of nature. Therefore, the missing word must logically connect the street to this natural setting, indicating *how* it exists within the hollow and in relation to the brook. It needs to convey a sense of place that would potentially cause surprise, as noted in Rachel Lynde’s reaction.\n\nSeveral possibilities exist, each with varying degrees of suitability. “Bridge” suggests a crossing of the brook, which is plausible but doesn’t fully capture the sense of unexpected placement. “Junction” implies a meeting of roads, fitting the ‘Main Street’ designation, but feels somewhat neutral and less connected to the specific landscape details. However, “turn” presents a stronger candidate, subtly hinting at a bend in the road nestled within the hollow, creating a less obvious or expected route.\n\nUltimately, while “turn” appears most likely given the available information and Rachel Lynde’s surprise, definitive confirmation would benefit from examining the complete paragraph. Resources like the [Avonlea Historical Society Website] might offer further contextual clues, such as historical maps or descriptions, to pinpoint the precise word Montgomery intended and fully understand its impact on the scene’s imagery and narrative flow.", "constraints": ["Your answer must also contain at least 2 placeholder (an example of a placeholder is [address])", "Please reply with exactly 4 paragraphs and separate each paragraph with two new lines.

{"instruction_id_list": ["combination:two_responses", "detectable_format:title", "keywords:existence", "keywords:forbidden_words"], "prompt": "For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. \ninput : Did M0 's executive producer , director , and writer found M1 , M2 , M3 , M4 , and M5 Provide exactly two anwers separated by ******.

Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.\nThe family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.\nWhen Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.\nAfter his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain's life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Cura ao to convince his fellow officers they've been poisoned. He also keeps correspondence with Minnie, developing a romance with the beautiful heiress.\nNear the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged. After being saved by another English vessel, he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely's sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property. Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father's name. He later journey's with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie, but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying. During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks, Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road. At the end of the novel, Percival proposes to Minnie, and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father. He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar. your reply should Include the keywords navy.

Homes had earlier been evacuated at Kirkconnel, in Dumfries and Galloway, and New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Flooding also caused disruption on the rail network and several road closures. Police in Dumfries and Galloway warned drivers not to travel unless it was \"absolutely necessary\". While all the main trunk routes were said to be passable with care in the area, many minor routes were closed or disrupted and some cars were abandoned. Travel Check if this is affecting your journey With more rain forecast on Tuesday morning, police said further flooding and disruption was possible. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency had more than 30 flood warnings in place on Monday evening. The seven people who were trapped upstairs at Nithside Farm - a father, four children under the age of eight and two holidaymakers - were rescued at about 19:00. Two dogs were also rescued, and all those involved were said to be safe and well. Elsewhere, heavy rain and winds of almost 80mph battered parts of Wales, affecting roads and train services. Met Office amber \"be prepared\" warnings for parts of Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire have now been lifted but yellow \"be aware\" warnings remain in place for these areas and much of central and southern Scotland. There is also a yellow warning for wind in Wales, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands, south-west England and London and the South East. There are yellow warnings for rain in Wales, Northern Ireland and south-west England. In Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and parts of Ayrshire have been worst affected. In the village of Carsphairn, in Dumfries and Galloway, residents described the conditions as some of the worst they had experienced in 40 years. Police said major roads across the region were affected by flooding including the A74(M) at Greenhillstairs, the A76 at Kirkconnel and the A75 at various points. About 40 houses in the St Conal's Square area of Kirkconnel were evacuated and a rest and welfare centre has been set up at the village's Miners Hall. Police said the village of Moniaive was almost cut off at one point due to flooding on the A702, and a family had to be evacuated from a bungalow which was cut off by flood water. Firefighters used rescue boats to assist with the evacuations. Homes in Port Logan and Newton Stewart also had to be evacuated. The Whitesands in Dumfries has flooded after the River Nith burst its banks. Electricity supply to this area has also been affected. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said it had attended 55 incidents which involved flooding or water rescues in the Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway area between 08:00 GMT and 18:00 GMT on Monday. One woman had to be rescued from a stranded car in Moffat. A number of properties were evacuated in Dundee after a landslide. Police Scotland said heavy rain had caused a wall to collapse at the rear of Gardner Street at about 16:00. No-one was injured, but properties were evacuated as a precautionary measure and some roads were closed in the area. Police Scotland said eight people had been evacuated from their homes in Mansefield Road in New Cumnock, and a further six homes were evacuated in the Leggate area. Police, fire crews and staff from the council and Scottish Water and Scottish Gas remained at the scene. In Glasgow, the M77 southbound entry slip was closed because of flooding at Junction 2 Barrhead Road. Trains from London Euston station to Edinburgh and Glasgow were disrupted by flooding.

People having to stay in hospital, even though they are well enough to be discharged, because there' s no social care in place for them . David Cameron says it's \"a demand problem\" . But it's not, of course . It's a supply problem . It's hard to make money from social care . So it's not massively amenable to privatisation . I suppose this was one of the areas where, Cameron fondly imagined, the Big Society would step in . As ever, instead, starving one part of the public sector of cash simply left another part struggling to cope with the consequences . Back in 2010, when Gordon Brown suggested implementing a 10% levy on inherited wealth to fund social care for older people , the Conservatives had this to say:\"RIP off. Now Gordon wants ? 20,000 when you die. Don't vote for Labour's new death tax.\" Instead , social care for older people has had its funding cut , so there' s simply not enough money to go round . The demand problem that Cameron now speaks of is one that was entirely predictable and, indeed, entirely predicted . Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades . Now this time has arrived , and there' s nothing there in the way of provision for it . Care for elderly people is one of those things that's not hard to sort out, given money, and almost impossible to sort out without it . It's one of those things that, in theory, offers choice- staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care . In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect of being in a position where they have to make such choices that they'd rather not think about it at all . One knows vaguely that there aren't many decent alternatives , so staying at home becomes the one thing that is comforting . Being close to the past matters when the present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death . It doesn't help that there's so much sentimentality around the issue . Myleene Klass appeared to believe she was being socially aware by banging on about how awful the idea of a mansion tax is , because it would hurt little old ladies living in big houses that had been their homes for decades . But ,  actually, Klass was describing something that isn't necessarily that desirable: an elderly person living in a home she can no longer heat, clean or look after, the neighbours she once knew long gone, clinging to the past instead of living in and enjoying the present . One of the great paradoxes of old age is that, at a time in life when change is very dynamic and has to be managed a lot, people are persuaded that trying to stop time, instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances, is the right thing to do . Care at home is pushed as the thing to aspire to, in part because - even though it's expensive, difficult to organise and not very satisfactory in outcome - it has the attractive advantage of needing no capital investment . Over Christmas, I watched the film Quartet , which is set in a retirement home for musicians . One was supposed to feel a bit sorry for its inhabitants , who had known success and adulation when they were young, and who missed those days . All they had to do to raise the funds to keep the home going was put on a concert featuring the legends that were themselves . Having looked at a couple of local care homes when my mother was ill a couple of years back , I can only say that the twilight years of those characters were indeed a fiction . Sure, nice retirement homes exist - if you can afford them . But the limitations of so many of them mean that the whole concept is sullied . Rather than being places where new phases of life are undertaken, they have become places you end up in when all hope of enjoying life is gone . It's interesting that inheritance has become so much an aspect of debate around care for elderly people . This, too, is a tacit signal that you are too old to spend your own money on yourself . At some point, the duty is to hang on to your assets, so that they can be passed on to your family - and without nasty government death taxes . It would be nice if people weren't encouraged to believe that it was selfish to invest in their own lives just because they are no longer young . Elderly people are blocking beds not just because they can no longer look after themselves at home, but also because our society is not encouraged to think of elderly lives as valuable and deserving of joy and fun, vitality and change . Lack of pay is one reason why people aren't queing up to work with older people . But another is that it's not seen as enjoyable , because older people are viewed as a bundle of sad, expensive, social-policy problems, rather than people with lives worth living to the full .

While this issue isn’t new, chronic underinvestment has escalated it into a full-blown crisis. The core of the problem isn’t simply increased demand for services, but a fundamental lack of resources to meet existing needs. This necessitates a shift in perspective, recognizing this as a resource allocation problem rather than solely a demand-side one.\n\nThe author contends that the current social care system is failing to adequately support the elderly. Specifically, they critique the focus on home care, noting that its perceived benefits can be misleading due to practical challenges related to cost and effective oversight. This highlights a systemic flaw where well-intentioned care approaches struggle to deliver on their promise, contributing to the overall strain on the system and impacting the quality of life for those receiving care.\n\nUltimately, the author advocates for comprehensive system reform aimed at providing more dignified and fulfilling care for the aging population. This extends beyond practical improvements to encompass a broader societal shift in how we view aging itself. Concerns surrounding inheritance and the perception of elders as burdens are identified as harmful societal attitudes that devalue the contributions and worth of older individuals, who deserve respect and robust support. The article’s central thesis is that the social care system is demonstrably failing and urgently requires fundamental reform.\n\nP.S.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firm’s at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. “How they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,” she said. “We need to get our test approved, and they’re not giving us an option of how to get it approved.”   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. “There will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,” she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. “If our test fails the validation, then it’s not fit to go to market,” she said. “I’m happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.” Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.

", "response": "<<Cellulose Synthesis: A Detailed Overview>>\n\nCellulose is formed through a process called cellulose synthesis, which occurs within plants, some bacteria, and oomycetes. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Glucose Source:** The process begins with glucose, a simple sugar produced during photosynthesis in plants.\n2. **UDP-Glucose Formation:** Glucose is converted into UDP-glucose (uridine diphosphate glucose). This is an activated form of glucose, meaning it’s prepared for polymerization.\n3. **Cellulose Synthase Complex:** The key enzyme responsible is the cellulose synthase complex. This isn't a single enzyme, but a large complex located in the plasma membrane. In plants, it’s specifically found in rosette-shaped structures.\n4. **Polymerization:** The cellulose synthase complex takes UDP-glucose molecules and links them together via β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. This creates a long, unbranched chain of glucose molecules – a cellulose polymer.\n5. **Microfibril Formation:** As these cellulose chains are synthesized, they self-assemble into highly ordered structures called microfibrils. Hydrogen bonds between the cellulose chains contribute to this organization, providing strength and stability. Multiple cellulose chains (typically 6-36) are bundled together to form a microfibril.\n6. **Crystallinity:** Cellulose microfibrils have both amorphous and crystalline regions. The crystalline regions are highly ordered and contribute to the material's strength, while the amorphous regions allow for some flexibility.\n7. **Cell Wall Deposition:** These microfibrils are then deposited into the cell wall, where they provide structural support to the plant cell. Other cell wall components like hemicellulose and lignin are deposited alongside the cellulose, further strengthening the wall.\n\nThe entire process is tightly regulated and influenced by factors like developmental stage, environmental conditions, and hormonal signals.\n\nP.S.

The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique.

The activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective pathway for the degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, decreases with age. We have analyzed the possible participation of CMA in the removal of oxidized proteins in rat liver and cultured mouse fibroblasts. Added to the fact that CMA substrates, when oxidized, are more efficiently internalized into lysosomes, we have found a constitutive activation of CMA during oxidative stress. Oxidation-induced activation of CMA correlates with higher levels of several components of the lysosomal translocation complex, but in particular of the lumenal chaperone, required for substrate uptake, and of the lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a, previously identified as a receptor for this pathway. In contrast with the well characterized mechanism of CMA activation during nutritional stress, which does not require de novo synthesis of the receptor, oxidation-induced activation of CMA is attained through transcriptional up-regulation of lamp2a. We conclude that CMA is activated during oxidative stress and that the higher activity of this pathway under these conditions, along with the higher susceptibility of the oxidized proteins to be taken up by lysosomes, both contribute to the efficient removal of oxidized proteins.

", "response": "<<Oxidative Stress and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy>>\n\nThe passage highlights a crucial connection between oxidative stress and the cellular process of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Specifically, oxidative stress serves as a trigger for the activation of CMA, a vital pathway responsible for the selective degradation of specific cytosolic proteins within lysosomes. This activation doesn’t occur randomly; rather, it’s driven by an increase in the production of key components of the CMA machinery. Notably, the passage details that oxidative stress leads to transcriptional up-regulation of LAMP2A, a lysosomal membrane protein functioning as the primary receptor for proteins targeted by CMA for degradation. This increased LAMP2A expression enhances the cell’s capacity to utilize CMA in response to the damaging effects of oxidative stress – a significant adaptation. Understanding this link is critical for comprehending cellular resilience.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. \ninput : Step 1: For each row in Campuses table, find corresponding rows in csu_fees table and in faculty table.\nStep 2: find the average CampusFee in the results of step 1 whose faculty's Year equals 1996 and csu_fees's Year equals 1996 Please respond to me only inde.

She held her breath, her fingers tracing the intricate, almost mournful carvings on a tarnished silver locket, a sense of foreboding settling over her. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck intensified, a distinct feeling that she was not alone, that something unseen was watching her every move. \n\nA sudden, sharp rapping on the glass door made her jump, her hand flying to her chest in surprise. She spun around, heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs, but the shop remained stubbornly empty, the street outside deserted. The only sounds were the wind’s mournful sigh and the rhythmic, deliberate ticking of a grandfather clock standing sentinel in the corner, each tick seeming to amplify the silence. She knew, with a growing certainty, that she should leave immediately, yet a strange, inexplicable compulsion kept her rooted to the spot, her feet seemingly glued to the worn floorboards.\n\nThe air grew thick and heavy, an oppressive silence descending, broken only by the relentless ticking of the clock, a constant reminder of passing time.

She felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to open it, a pull so strong it felt almost physical, overriding her growing apprehension. \n\nAs her fingers brushed the cover, a faint, almost imperceptible hum resonated through the room, vibrating in the very bones of the building. The book seemed to pulse with a life of its own, the shadows around it swirling and twisting into grotesque, fleeting shapes, playing tricks on her eyes. She hesitated, a wave of profound unease washing over her, chilling her to the core; she knew she shouldn't, that opening the book was a terrible idea, but she found herself utterly unable to resist the dark allure.

This skill is crucial in legal proceedings, where lawyers must be able to articulate their arguments clearly and persuasively to influence judges and juries. However, this same skill can also be perceived as aggressive or confrontational, leading to the perception of lawyers being argumentative.\n\nSection 2: The perception of lawyers as argumentative can also be influenced by media portrayals in films and television.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year » . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending » . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .end it with a post script starting with P.P.S.

", "response": "The interplay between beverages and food is a cornerstone of enjoyable dining and relaxation, extending far beyond simple thirst quenching or sustenance. Consider the deeply ingrained habit of pairing coffee with a pastry – a ritual for countless individuals, providing not just a caffeine boost but a comforting sensory experience. The warmth of the coffee, the sweetness and texture of the pastry, create a synergy that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Similarly, a glass of lemonade on a sweltering day isn’t merely about hydration; it’s the bright, acidic tang cutting through the heat, offering a revitalizing contrast. And for moments demanding celebration, champagne’s effervescence and delicate flavor profile elevate the occasion, signaling festivity and joy. These pairings aren’t accidental; they’re built on understanding how flavors and sensations complement each other.\n\n***\n\nMoving beyond these common examples, the possibilities become wonderfully diverse. A quiet evening often calls for the gentle warmth of tea, perhaps enhanced with a slice of lemon to brighten the flavor and add a touch of Vitamin C. This pairing is inherently soothing, promoting relaxation and contemplation. When indulging in a substantial meal, a well-chosen red wine can transform the experience; the tannins in the wine work to cut through the richness of the food, cleansing the palate and highlighting the dish’s complexities. Conversely, lighter fare often benefits from brighter, more refreshing beverages. A social gathering practically *demands* a vibrant cocktail like a margarita – its balance of sweet, sour, and salty flavors encourages conversation and conviviality.\n\n***\n\nUltimately, the art of pairing beverages and culinary delights is a deeply personal journey of discovery. While established combinations offer a reliable starting point, the “perfect” pairing is subjective and dependent on individual preferences. The goal isn’t simply to find what *works*, but to explore how different combinations can enhance and elevate the overall experience, creating moments that are more enjoyable and truly memorable. Don’t be afraid to experiment – to try unexpected combinations and to trust your own palate.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.Response must also contain exactly 4 bullet points in markdown format.

This selection represented a bold move by FIFA to expand the global reach of football and introduce the sport to a new region. The event was met with both excitement and scrutiny, focusing on aspects like infrastructure development, cultural considerations, and human rights concerns, ultimately delivering a unique and memorable tournament experience. Qatar’s successful hosting demonstrated the capability of nations outside of the traditional European and South American strongholds to stage a major international sporting event.\n\n***\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, the FIFA World Cup will be jointly hosted by three North American nations: the United States, Mexico, and Canada. This marks a return to North America for the tournament after the United States hosted in 1994, and also provides Mexico with its third hosting opportunity (previously hosting in 1970 and 1986). Canada will be hosting matches for the first time in its history. The joint bid was selected to leverage the existing infrastructure and passionate fan bases across the three countries, promising a large-scale and commercially successful event. \n\n***\n\nA key change accompanying the 2026 World Cup is the expansion of the tournament format. The 2022 edition in Qatar was the last to feature 32 teams. The 2026 tournament will significantly increase the number of participating nations to 48, reflecting FIFA’s aim to broaden inclusivity and provide more opportunities for countries to compete on the world stage. This expansion will necessitate adjustments to the tournament schedule and qualifying processes, creating a larger and more diverse celebration of global football.", "constraints": ["provide a title wrapped in double angular brackets in your response, such as <<title>>", "highlight at least 2 key point by wrapping it with *.

Rationale for Question Selection: Assessing Creative Thinking & Humor**\n\nI chose this question specifically because of its unconventional nature. It’s designed to be a playful “brain bender” that moves beyond typical interview responses. The primary goal isn’t to elicit a *correct* answer, but to observe the candidate’s ability to think laterally, demonstrate a unique sense of humor, and navigate a lighthearted inquiry within a professional context. It provides insight into their personality and how they respond to the unexpected.\n\n***\n\n**B. The Intentional Absurdity & Its Value**\n\nThe question deliberately incorporates an element of the nonsensical. This isn’t a flaw, but a feature. The slight absurdity serves to disarm candidates and encourages them to engage with the question in a more creative and less guarded manner. The subtle pun-like quality tests their ability to recognize and appreciate playful ambiguity.\n\n***\n\n**C. Uncovering Problem-Solving Approaches**\n\nBeyond humor, the question is a valuable tool for assessing problem-solving skills. It reveals *how* a candidate approaches an unusual challenge, not simply *what* they produce as a solution. The process of their thought – their initial reaction, their attempts to rationalize the question, and their eventual response – are all informative.\n\n***\n\n**D. Fostering a Relaxed Interview Dynamic**\n\nIntroducing a fun question like this helps to create a more relaxed and engaging interview atmosphere. It signals to the candidate that the interview isn’t solely focused on rigid assessment, and that personality and a positive attitude are valued. This can encourage more authentic and open communication. It also subtly gauges whether the candidate is someone who can contribute to a positive work environment.\n\n***\n\n**E. Avoiding Redundancy & Reinforcing the Core Benefit**\n\nThe original response contained repetitive statements (\"It's a good question to ask, because it's a fun question.\"). This has been removed. The core benefit remains: this question is a valuable addition to the interview process because it offers a unique perspective on a candidate’s thinking style, humor, and ability to handle unconventional situations.

Recognizing this impact is a crucial step towards more inclusive communication.\n\n***\n\nA more inclusive and contemporary alternative is: ‘THE DISCOVERY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ALL OF HUMANITY.’ This revision replaces the potentially limiting \"mankind\" with \"humanity,\" a term that encompasses all people regardless of gender.\n\n***\n\nFurther refinements could also consider the broader definition of “discovery” and its impact. While focusing on *humanity* is a strong improvement, acknowledging potential impacts on other sentient life (should it be discovered) could be a future consideration for truly universal phrasing. However, for the immediate concern of gender inclusivity, the suggested reframe is effective.\n\n***\n\nUltimately, mindful language use demonstrates respect and promotes equity.

Different objects reflect different wavelengths our eyes interpret as different colors.\n\n* **light and its wavelengths:** Light is tiny particles called photons.

Red light for example has a longer wavelength than blue light.\n\n* **how our eyes perceive color:** Our eyes have special cells called cones sensitive to different light wavelengths. There are three cone types each sensitive to a range: red green and blue. When light hits our eyes the cones send signals to the brain which interprets them as color.\n\n* **how we experience color:** Seeing color means our brain processes information from the cones. This information combines with other sensory input like texture temperature and smell creating our color perception.

It initializes a variable `total` to zero.  A `for` loop then iterates through each number `i` in the range from `k` up to and including `n`. In each iteration, the current number `i` is added to the `total`. Finally, the function returns the accumulated `total`, which represents the sum of the integers.\n\n***\n\n**Methodology & Efficiency:**\n\nThis code employs an iterative approach to calculate the sum.  This is generally preferred over a recursive solution for this problem due to the overhead associated with function calls in recursion. The iterative method directly accumulates the sum within a loop, making it more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The time complexity is O(n-k+1), meaning the execution time grows linearly with the number of integers being summed.\n\n***\n\n**Example and Output:**\n\n```python\n# Example usage\nk = 1\nn = 5\nsum_result = sum_of_integers(k, n)\nprint(f\"The sum of integers from {k} to {n} is: {sum_result}\")\n```\n\nThis example sets `k` to 1 and `n` to 5. The function calculates the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, which equals 15.

This assertion lacks any credible evidence and contradicts established records of space exploration during that period. It’s important to address such claims with factual information to maintain a clear understanding of historical events.\n\n**Section B: The Facts**\n\nThe Soviet Union, officially known as the USSR, was a formidable competitor to the United States throughout the space race, achieving remarkable firsts in the field. They successfully launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, and propelled Yuri Gagarin into orbit as the first human in space, alongside completing the first spacewalk with Alexei Leonov. Despite these impressive achievements, the Soviet Union never accomplished a crewed lunar landing, and the proposed date of September 13, 1959, predates the technological capabilities necessary for such a feat. Their focus, while extensive, remained on different aspects of space exploration.\n\n**Section C: The Timeline**\n\nThe universally recognized first human landing on the moon occurred on July 20, 1969, as part of the American Apollo 11 mission, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the lunar surface. The Soviet Union pursued its own lunar programs, notably the Luna and Zond series, but these were ultimately unsuccessful in achieving a crewed landing due to substantial technical difficulties and the immense logistical challenges involved. These programs faced setbacks with rocket development, particularly the N1 rocket, which experienced multiple launch failures.\n\n**Section D: Conclusion**\n\nTherefore, the assertion that the Soviet Union landed humans on the moon on September 13, 1959, is demonstrably false and unsupported by historical evidence. While the Soviet space program was undeniably innovative and contributed significantly to our understanding of space, the Apollo 11 mission rightfully holds its place in history as the first successful crewed lunar landing.

Make sure to include a postscript starting with P.S.. In your response please avoid using commas. Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***. ", "response": "<<Reducing Unconscious Bias: A Comprehensive Approach>>\n\nUnconscious bias refers to the subtle, automatic thoughts and feelings that influence our judgments and decisions without our awareness. These biases stem from a complex interplay of factors including upbringing, cultural background, and personal experiences. They can manifest in various ways – favoring certain groups over others, making assumptions about individuals based on stereotypes, and overlooking valuable qualities in favor of others. Recognizing the pervasive nature of these biases is the crucial first step towards mitigation.\n\n***\n\n**I. Foundational Awareness & Self-Reflection**\n\nThe initial and arguably most important step in reducing unconscious bias is cultivating awareness of its existence. This involves acknowledging that biases are common to all individuals and *will* impact our interactions, regardless of intent. Individuals can actively engage in self-reflection through targeted questioning: What are my underlying assumptions about different groups? What stereotypes, even subtle ones, do I hold? How might my past experiences, both positive and negative, be influencing my current judgments and perceptions? Journaling, mindfulness practices, and seeking feedback from trusted sources can aid this process.\n\n***\n\n**II. Education & Targeted Training Programs**\n\nOrganizations and individuals benefit significantly from structured educational programs specifically addressing unconscious bias. These programs should move beyond simple definitions and delve into the neurological basis of bias, the different *types* of biases (affinity bias, confirmation bias, etc.), and their demonstrable impact on decision-making. Effective training incorporates interactive exercises, realistic case studies, and role-playing scenarios designed to help participants identify, challenge, and ultimately reframe their own biases in a safe and constructive environment.\n\n***\n\n**III. Inclusive Practices: Language, Communication & Representation**\n\nPractical application of bias reduction requires conscious effort in daily interactions. This begins with adopting inclusive language and communication practices. Avoid gendered language, utilize neutral terms whenever possible, and be mindful of the potential impact of the language used to describe people and groups. Crucially, this also involves actively listening to and genuinely valuing diverse perspectives – seeking out and amplifying voices that are often marginalized. Beyond language, fostering diverse teams and promoting representation at *all* levels of an organization is vital. Diverse teams bring a wider range of experiences and viewpoints, challenging existing biases and leading to more equitable outcomes.\n\n***\n\n**IV.

Instilling positive habits early on can have a profound impact on a child's future success, happiness, and well-being. These habits, when nurtured and reinforced, can help children become well-rounded individuals with strong character and a positive outlook on life. \n\n**READING**\n\nReading is a cornerstone of a child's intellectual and emotional growth. From the moment a child starts to grasp the concept of words, reading opens up a world of imagination and knowledge. Reading exposes them to new vocabulary, expands their understanding of the world, and fosters a love for learning. It also helps develop their critical thinking skills, improves their comprehension, and strengthens their language skills. Encourage your child to read for pleasure, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. Make it a family activity, visit the library together, and let them choose books that spark their interest.\n\n**HEALTH & SAFETY**\n\nInstilling a sense of responsibility and awareness about safety is vital. Teach your child about basic hygiene, such as washing hands, brushing teeth, and staying hydrated. Explain the importance of wearing appropriate clothing for different weather conditions and recognizing potentially unsafe environments. Encourage them to listen to their bodies and seek help when they are feeling unwell. These simple habits can prevent accidents and illnesses, ensuring their physical well-being.\n\n**POSITIVITY**\n\nA positive attitude can make a world of difference in a child's life. Help them develop resilience by teaching them to view challenges as opportunities for growth and to celebrate their successes, no matter how small. Encourage them to focus on the good things in their lives and to practice self-compassion. Help them develop coping mechanisms for dealing with difficult emotions and setbacks. Model positive self-talk and demonstrate how to learn from mistakes.\n\nP.S. Remember that consistency is key when building habits. Small, regular efforts are more effective than occasional grand gestures.\n\nP.P.S. Don't forget to tailor these habits to your child's age and developmental stage.

Your response must contain 3 sections, mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X. The number of sentences in your response should be at least 5. ", "response": "## SECTION X: Understanding Belly Fat \n\nIt's important to understand that spot reduction of fat is a common myth – you cannot target fat loss in just one specific area of your body through exercise. While it’s tempting to focus solely on abdominal exercises, reducing overall body fat is the key to achieving a smaller waistline and a healthier physique. This is accomplished through a dedicated combination of a healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity. Before beginning any new exercise program, it’s always a wise decision to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure it’s appropriate for your individual needs and health status. Remember that sustainable changes are more effective than quick fixes.\n\n## SECTION X: Effective Exercises for Home Workouts\n\nHere are some effective exercises you can incorporate into your home workouts to help burn calories and contribute to overall fat reduction, including belly fat:\n\n* **Cardio:** Engaging in cardio exercises like running in place, jumping jacks, burpees, and high knees is an excellent way to elevate your heart rate and burn a significant number of calories, while also improving your cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio on most days of the week, adjusting the duration and intensity as you become fitter.\n* **Strength Training:** Strength training exercises, such as squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks, are crucial for building muscle mass. Increased muscle mass boosts your metabolism, meaning you burn more calories even when you are at rest. Here are a few examples of bodyweight exercises you can easily do at home:\n    * **Squats:** Perform 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, focusing on proper form.\n    * **Lunges:** Complete 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions per leg, maintaining a stable core.\n    * **Push-ups:** Do 3 sets of as many repetitions as possible (AMRAP), and modify by performing them on your knees if needed to maintain good form.\n    * **Plank:** Hold the plank position for 30-60 seconds, repeating 3 times, and focus on engaging your core throughout.\n* **Core Work:** Exercises like crunches, planks, and leg raises directly target your abdominal muscles, strengthening and toning the area. While these exercises won’t directly eliminate belly fat, they are important for building a strong core and improving your overall posture and stability. You can easily find guided core workout routines online to add variety to your training.\n\n##", "constraints": ["Your answer must also contain at least 2 placeholder (an example of a placeholder is [address])", "Your response must contain 3 sections, mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X", "The number of sentences in your response should be at least 5"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, false], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 2}, {"section_spliter": "SECTION", "num_sections": 3}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 5}]}

", "response": "Whether you can sue an airline for a refund after a flight cancellation depends heavily on the reason for the cancellation and the applicable laws. Generally airlines must offer refunds when they cancel a flight regardless of the reason though the specific regulations vary by jurisdiction.\n\nFor example cancellations due to mechanical issues staffing shortages or airline decisions typically trigger a refund obligation. However cancellations stemming from “force majeure” events – truly extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline’s control like widespread natural disasters – may allow airlines to offer alternatives like travel credits instead of immediate refunds. Determining what qualifies as “force majeure” is often a point of contention.\n\nBefore pursuing legal action carefully review the airline’s contract of carriage terms and conditions. This document outlines their obligations. It’s also vital to research passenger rights in your country or region regulations like those in the EU EC 261 or the US Department of Transportation provide specific protections.

Exhaust all avenues for resolution with the airline first.\n\nThe legal landscape concerning flight cancellation refunds is complex and geographically dependent. Your ability to successfully sue an airline hinges on understanding the laws governing air travel in your location and the specifics of the cancellation.\n\nMany countries and regions have regulations dictating airline responsibilities to passengers when flights are cancelled. For instance the EU’s EC 261 regulation provides substantial compensation and refund rights. The US Department of Transportation also has rules though generally less generous. Always begin by researching the regulations applicable to your origin and destination.\n\nBeyond governmental regulations the airline’s own contract of carriage is crucial. This document details their policies on refunds rebooking and compensation. If the airline fails to adhere to these policies or applicable laws you may have grounds for a claim.

Students will learn basic **syntax** and write their first program. **Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types** will cover **variables** (named storage locations) and **data types** like **integers**, **floats**, **strings**, and **booleans**, focusing on assignment and basic operations. This chapter will also include a practical exercise on [data type conversion]. **Chapter 3: Operators and Expressions** will detail **operators** (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment) and how to build **expressions**. Finally, **Chapter 4: Control Flow and Decision Making** will introduce **control flow** with **conditional statements** (if-else) and **loops** (for and while), culminating in a small project to build a [simple calculator application].", "constraints": ["Don't forget to include the keywords explanations", "Give me the answer in exactly two paragraphs, separated with the markdown divider: ***", "The word course should appear at least 2 times in the song", "make sure it contains at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [name]"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, true, false], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["explanations"]}, {"num_paragraphs": 2}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "course", "frequency": 2}, {"num_placeholders": 3}]}

Make sure the word loud appears at least 2 times. Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***. ", "response": "**Understanding the Term \"Cacophony\"**\n\nThe underlined word, \"cacophony,\" denotes a jarring and unpleasant combination of sounds – a harsh, discordant mixture. It’s frequently employed to characterize environments filled with noise that is not harmonious or pleasing to the ear. Essentially, it represents a clashing of sounds.\n\n***\n\n**Etymological Roots**\n\nThe word’s origin provides further insight into its meaning. \"Cacophony\" stems from the Greek language, specifically combining \"kakos,\" meaning \"bad\" or \"ugly,\" and \"phonē,\" meaning \"sound.\" This etymology directly reflects the negative connotation associated with the term.\n\n***\n\n**Contextual Interpretation of the Sentence**\n\nThe sentence, \"Despite the cacophony, the student tried to study,\" paints a clear picture. It indicates a scenario where a student is attempting to concentrate on their studies while simultaneously contending with a disruptive and noisy surrounding environment. The \"cacophony\" is presented as an obstacle to effective learning.\n\n***\n\n**Grammatical Function: Noun vs. Adjective**\n\nA crucial point to note is the grammatical role of \"cacophony.\" It functions as a *noun*, representing the *thing* – the unpleasant sound blend itself – rather than an *adjective* that *describes* something else. It’s easy to mistakenly think of it as describing the sounds, but it *is* the description of the sounds, embodied as a noun.\n\n***\n\n**Identifying the Best Answer**\n\nGiven the meaning and context, the most accurate answer choice is **A. Loud sounds**. While \"cacophony\" encompasses more than just volume (it implies discordance and unpleasantness), \"loud sounds\" captures the core element of the disruptive noise the student is facing.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.Make sure to highlight at least 3 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. use *highlighted section*.

Imagine yourself delivering the presentation with confidence, and visualize a successful outcome.\n\n**Section 2. Breathe Deeply**\n\nOne of the most effective ways to manage nerves is through deep breathing. Practice deep, slow breaths before and during your presentation. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This will help to calm your heart rate and slow down your breathing, which can help to reduce anxiety.\n\n**Section 3. Focus on Your Audience**\n\nRemember, your audience is there to listen and learn. Focus on connecting with them and sharing your knowledge. Make eye contact with different members of the audience, smile, and use a friendly tone of voice. This will help to create a positive and engaging atmosphere.\n\n**Section 4. Embrace the Moment**\n\nIt's okay to feel nervous, but try to channel that energy into excitement. Remember, you've prepared for this moment, and you have something valuable to share.

", "response": "Here are some key points about US history:\n\n**SECTION 1: Colonial Period**\n\nThe United States’ history begins with the arrival of European settlers in the 1600s. These settlers, driven by various motivations like religious freedom and economic opportunity, established settlements along the Atlantic shore. The relationship between the settlements and the British Crown was complex, marked by tensions over taxation and representation. The American Revolution, sparked by the desire for independence, led to the formation of the United States of America in 1776.\n\n**SECTION 2: The Revolution and Early Republic**\n\nThe American Revolution was a pivotal moment in world history. The settlers, led by figures like George Washington, fought for their freedom from British rule. The newly formed nation faced hurdles in establishing a stable government and navigating the complexities of a new world order. The Constitution, ratified in 1787, established a framework for a federal republic, with a system of checks and balances designed to prevent tyranny.\n\n**SECTION 3: Industrialization and Expansion**\n\nThe 19th century saw the United States undergo a period of rapid industrial growth. New technologies like the cotton gin and the steam engine transformed the economy and led to westward expansion. This expansion, however, had a downside, as Native American populations were displaced and conflicts over land and resources arose. The Civil War, a defining moment in American history, was fought over the issue of slavery and the future of the nation.\n\n**SECTION 4: The 20th Century**\n\nThe 20th century was a period of significant change for the United States. World Wars I and II shaped the nation's role in the world, leading to the rise of the United States as a global power. The Cold War, a period of ideological conflict between the US and the Soviet Union, dominated much of the latter half of the century. The Rights Movement, a pivotal struggle for racial equality, brought about significant social change.\n\n**SECTION 5: The Modern Era**\n\nThe United States continues to grapple with complex issues in the 21st century. The nation faces hurdles like economic inequality, climate change, and political division. The world is increasingly interconnected, and the United States plays a vital role in global affairs. The country's future will be shaped by its ability to address these hurdles and navigate a changing world.", "constraints": ["Please limit the number of words with all capital letters to at least 4", "reply with 5 sections.

Hvis et hvilket som helst tall innenfor dette området deler `tall` jevnt (resten er 0), returnerer urr funksjon umiddelbart `Usann`, og indikerer at det ikke er et primtall.\n\n***\n\nHvis løkken fullføres uten å finne noen divisorer, returnerer urr funksjon selvsikkert `Sann`, og bekrefter at inndata `tall` faktisk er et primtall. Urr eksempelbruk demonstrerer hvordan du kaller funksjonen og tolker resultatet, og viser tydelig hvordan du bestemmer om et gitt tall er et primtall eller ikke. Urr bruk av en f-streng for utdata gjør resultatet lettlest og informativt.\n\n***\n\nUrr tilnærming gir en balanse mellom lesbarhet og effektivitet. Selv om mer sofistikerte primtallstester finnes (som Miller-Rabin-testen for svært store tall), er urr funksjon godt egnet for de fleste vanlige bruksområder der ytelse ikke er kritisk.

", "response": "```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The `==` operator in Java is a comparison operator that checks for object identity, meaning it compares the memory addresses of two objects. It's not always reliable for comparing strings, especially when dealing with string manipulation. **Why `==` is not always reliable for comparing strings:** String objects are internally stored differently: Java strings are internally represented as objects. The `==` operator compares the memory addresses of these objects, not the actual content. Case sensitivity: `==` doesn't account for case sensitivity. Two strings with different capitalization might be considered equal. String manipulation: If you've modified a string, `==` might not reflect the actual comparison. **When to use `.equals()`:** Case-sensitive comparison: Use `.equals()` to compare strings for equality based on their content, including case sensitivity. String manipulation: `.equals()` is designed to handle string manipulation, ensuring that the comparison is accurate after any modifications. **Example:** ```java String str1 = \\\"Hello\\\"; String str2 = \\\"hello\\\"; // Using == will not work as expected if (str1 == str2) { System.out.println(\\\"Strings are equal\\\"); } // Using equals() will work as expected if (str1.equals(str2)) { System.out.println(\\\"Strings are equal\\\"); } ``` **The bug you encountered:** The bug you encountered likely stemmed from the fact that `==` was not comparing the actual content of the strings, but rather their memory addresses. Using `.equals()` ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the strings, which is crucial for accurate string comparisons. **In summary:** Use `==` for object identity checks. Use `.equals()` for case-sensitive string comparisons and string manipulation. **Key takeaway:** Always use `.equals()` when comparing strings in Java to ensure accurate comparisons.\"\n}\n```", "constraints": ["Wrap all words into one JSON block", "use the keywords bug"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, true], "kwargs": [{}, {"keywords": ["bug"]}]}

", "response": "**Understanding Data Duplication in SQL**\n\nDuplicate values within a database table represent instances where multiple rows share identical data across specified columns. These duplicates can arise from various sources, including manual data entry errors, flawed data import processes, or unintentional replication during data manipulation. Identifying and addressing these duplicates is paramount for maintaining data integrity, ensuring accurate reporting, and optimizing database performance. Ignoring duplicates can lead to incorrect analytical results and application errors.\n\n***\n\n**Methods for Identifying Duplicate Rows**\n\nSQL offers several powerful techniques to pinpoint duplicate records. The optimal method often depends on the specific database system being used and the complexity of the duplication scenario. Here's a detailed look at common approaches:\n\n* **`GROUP BY` and `HAVING` Clause:** This is a straightforward method for identifying duplicates. It groups rows based on the specified columns and then uses the `HAVING` clause to filter for groups that appear more than once, indicating duplication.\n   *Example:* `SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount FROM table_name GROUP BY column1, column2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`  This query returns the values of `column1` and `column2` that are duplicated, along with the number of times each combination appears.\n\n* **Window Functions – `ROW_NUMBER()`:** Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition.  By partitioning based on the columns you suspect contain duplicates, you can identify rows beyond the first occurrence.\n   *Example:*\n   ```sql\n   WITH RowNumCTE AS (\n       SELECT column1, column2,\n              ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2 ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNum\n       FROM table_name\n   )\n   SELECT column1, column2\n   FROM RowNumCTE\n   WHERE RowNum > 1;\n   ```\n   This CTE (Common Table Expression) assigns a row number to each row within each group of `column1` and `column2` values. The final `SELECT` statement retrieves only those rows where the `RowNum` is greater than 1, effectively identifying duplicates.\n\n* **`EXISTS` Subquery:** This method uses a subquery to check for the existence of other rows with the same values in the specified columns.\n   *Example:*", "constraints": ["Make sure the answer contains exactly 3 bullet points in markdown format", "Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***", "the total number of words in your response should be at least 15"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, true], "kwargs": [{"num_bullets": 3}, {"num_paragraphs": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 15}]}

", "response": "SECTION I: Understanding the Statement\n\nThe statement \"For every integer k, k² + 2k + 1 ≥ 0\" asserts that the expression k² + 2k + 1 will always result in a non-negative value when evaluated with any integer *k*. This means that no matter what integer you choose for *k*, squaring it, adding twice its value, and then adding one will never produce a negative number. Essentially, the statement proposes a universal truth about this quadratic expression within the domain of integers.\n\nSECTION II: Relevant Mathematical Fact\n\nA cornerstone of real number properties is the non-negativity of squares; formally, for any real number *x*, x² ≥ 0. This fundamental principle dictates that the square of any real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, is always greater than or equal to zero. Consequently, this property extends to all subsets of real numbers, including the integers.\n\nSECTION III: Applying the Fact to the Statement\n\nSince the set of integers is entirely contained within the set of real numbers, the principle established in Section II directly applies to integer values of *k*. Furthermore, recognizing k² + 2k + 1 as a perfect square trinomial allows us to rewrite the expression as (k + 1)². Therefore, the statement is equivalent to proving (k + 1)² ≥ 0 for all integers *k*.\n\nSECTION IV: Conclusion\n\nGiven that (k + 1) will always be an integer when *k* is an integer, and knowing that the square of any integer is non-negative, we can definitively conclude that (k + 1)² ≥ 0 holds true for all integer values of *k*. This directly validates the original statement, k² + 2k + 1 ≥ 0, demonstrating its truthfulness across the entire domain of integers.

Mastering these endings is crucial for forming grammatically correct and understandable sentences.\n\nSECTION 2: Significance of Verb Endings\nGerman verb endings aren’t merely grammatical markers; they fundamentally alter the verb’s meaning by conveying *when* the action takes place and *who* is performing it. Incorrect endings can lead to miscommunication.\n\nSECTION 3: Core Function: Tense, Person, and Number\nThe primary function of these endings is to conjugate the verb, meaning to modify it to reflect the tense (past, present, future), the person (I, you, he/she/it, we, you [plural], they), and the number (singular or plural) of the subject.\n\nSECTION 4: Example: \"Sprechen\" (to speak)\nConsider the verb \"sprechen\" (to speak). Its form changes significantly depending on the subject. For instance, \"ich spreche\" (I speak) differs from \"er spricht\" (he speaks) and \"wir sprechen\" (we speak). These variations demonstrate how endings denote person and number within the present tense. Different tenses will require entirely different ending patterns.\n\nSECTION 5: Word Order and Verb Position\nWhile primarily about conjugation, verb endings also influence sentence structure. In main clauses, the conjugated verb typically occupies the second position. In subordinate clauses, the conjugated verb usually appears at the very end of the clause. The correct ending is essential for this positioning to be grammatically sound.", "constraints": ["The entire reply should contain a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>", "Answer in lowercase letters only, throughout your entire answer", "response should contain the keyword \"position\"", "Your response must contain 5 sections, mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, true, false], "kwargs": [{}, {}, {"keywords": ["position"]}, {"section_spliter": "SECTION", "num_sections": 5}]}

THE CHOICE BETWEEN “MEAL” AND “DINNER” FURTHER REFINES THE CONTEXT, MOVING FROM A GENERAL STATE OF FOOD READINESS TO A SPECIFIC OCCASION – PERHAPS A FAMILY GATHERING AT [ADDRESS].\n\n***\n\nTHE EXPLANATION DETAILING *WHY* THESE REVISIONS ARE IMPROVEMENTS IS ALSO SOUND. HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF PRECISION IN LANGUAGE IS CRUCIAL FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. AMBIGUITY, EVEN IN SEEMINGLY SIMPLE STATEMENTS, CAN LEAD TO ERRORS, WASTED TIME, OR EVEN FRUSTRATION. THE EXAMPLE OF SUBSTITUTING “COOKED” FOR “READY TO EAT” IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, DEMONSTRATING HOW A DESCRIPTIVE ADJECTIVE IMMEDIATELY CLARIFIES THE STATE OF THE CHICKEN. SIMILARLY, FRAMING THE FOOD AS A “DINNER” RATHER THAN A GENERIC “MEAL” PROVIDES A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTENDED CONTEXT AND TIMING. CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMING A GUEST NAMED [NAME] THAT DINNER IS READY.\n\n***\n\nULTIMATELY, THIS EXERCISE UNDERSCORES A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF GOOD WRITING: PRIORITIZING CLARITY.

The movement has grown considerably, initiating a wider conversation regarding trade’s role in advancing human rights and social justice.\n\n***\n\nA key tenet of fair trade is the advancement of **labour** standards. This encompasses ensuring workers earn a living wage, have access to safe and healthy workplaces, and are protected from exploitation. Fair trade organizations frequently collaborate directly with producers to establish these standards, offering training, assistance, and monitoring to verify adherence. The improvement of **labour** conditions is central to the movement’s philosophy, recognizing that dignified work is a fundamental human right.\n\n***\n\nFurthermore, environmental sustainability is a crucial component of fair trade. The movement stresses minimizing the environmental impact of production. This involves encouraging sustainable farming methods, reducing waste generation, and limiting the use of hazardous chemicals. Fair trade certification frequently mandates that producers meet rigorous environmental standards, ensuring their operations are ecologically responsible. Fair trade also tackles broader social justice concerns – poverty, gender inequality, and access to education – by providing equitable pricing and supporting fair trade organizations, ultimately empowering producers, improving livelihoods, and fostering greater social equity.

These relate to both the structural correctness of the code and the intended output it produces.

In gu, indentation is crucial for defining code blocks. Without proper indentation, the interpreter cannot determine which statements belong within the `for` loop. This is a fundamental aspect of gu's syntax.\n\n***\n\n**Issue 2: Logical Inaccuracy - Incorrect Output**\n\nWhile the loop itself was likely functional (once indentation is corrected), the original code didn't achieve the stated goal of printing the numbers 0 through 9. Instead, it appears to have been printing a static string \"Answer is:\" concatenated with the loop index. This indicates a misunderstanding of how to access and display the loop variable's value.\n\n***\n\n**Corrected Code & Explanation**\n\nHere's the corrected gu code:\n\n```gu\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(f\"Answer is: {i}\")\n```\n\n*   `for i in range(10):`: This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates ten times. The `range(10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 10.  In each iteration, the variable `i` takes on the next value in this sequence.\n*   `print(f\"Answer is: {i}\")`: This line prints the desired output. The `f` before the string indicates an f-string (formatted string literal).  F-strings allow you to embed expressions, in this case the value of the variable `i`, directly within the string using curly braces `{}`.\n\n***\n\n**Expected Output & Key Changes**\n\nThe corrected code will produce the following output:\n\n```\nAnswer is: 0\nAnswer is: 1\nAnswer is: 2\nAnswer is: 3\nAnswer is: 4\nAnswer is: 5\nAnswer is: 6\nAnswer is: 7\nAnswer is: 8\nAnswer is: 9\n```\n\nThe key changes implemented were:\n\n*   **Indentation:** The `print` statement is now correctly indented, signifying that it belongs to the `for", "constraints": ["In your response please avoid using commas", "Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***", "end it with a post script starting with P.P.S", "be sure the letter j appears less than 5 times in your response", "using only gu, no other language is allowed"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, false, true, true, false], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_paragraphs": 3}, {"postscript_marker": "P.P.S"}, {"let_relation": "less than", "letter": "j", "let_frequency": 5}, {"language": "gu"}]}

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

These models traditionally rely on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks, employing an encoder to process the input sequence and a decoder to generate the output. A crucial component connecting the encoder and decoder is the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when producing each element of the output. **ATTENTION** is indeed key to the performance of these earlier models.\n\nHowever, these recurrent and convolutional approaches can be computationally expensive, particularly with long sequences, and often require substantial training time and resources. To address these limitations, the authors of this paper introduce the Transformer, a novel architecture that fundamentally departs from traditional sequence transduction models by eliminating recurrence and convolutions entirely. This new design relies *solely* on attention mechanisms – a **REVOLUTIONARY** approach that enables parallelization and improved efficiency. **TRANSFORMERS** offer significant advantages in both training speed and model performance, and **TRANSFORMERS** are now widely considered **STATE-OF-THE-ART** for many sequence transduction tasks.

It declares the document class, which dictates the overall layout, formatting rules, and available commands. The `article` class is a versatile and commonly used choice, suitable for a wide range of documents like articles, short reports, and simple papers.

The current text lacks any practical value and needs substantial revision to fulfill the original request.\n\nTo effectively utilize binary search, you need a sorted dataset. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the middle element is the target value, the search is successful.

This process continues until the target is found or the interval is empty, indicating the target is not present.\n\nAn efficient implementation often involves working with an array.

Highlight at least 2 text sections, i.e. *highlighted section*. ", "response": "It's a fascinating question! While AI is rapidly advancing, the idea of AI completely replacing politicians is a complex one. There's no simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Here's a breakdown of the current research and some key considerations:\n\n**AI's Potential in Politics:**\n\n* **Campaigning and Communication:** AI can analyze data to target voters effectively, personalize messages, and even generate content. Research has shown that AI-powered tools can improve campaign efficiency and outreach. For example, a [**2023 study by the University of Oxford’s Internet Institute**] found that AI could help identify potential voters and tailor messages for better engagement.\n* **Policy Analysis and Research:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify trends, predict outcomes, and generate policy recommendations. This can be helpful for policymakers, but it's important to remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment and ethical considerations. [**A recent report by the Brookings Institution, published in early 2024**] explored the potential of AI in policy analysis, highlighting its ability to process and analyze complex data sets.\n* **Legislative Processes:** AI could potentially automate tasks like drafting legislation, tracking bills, and managing legislative databases. However, the ethical implications of AI-driven legislation are still being debated. [**The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report**] anticipates increased AI integration in legislative support roles.\n\n**Why AI Isn't a Complete Replacement:**\n\n* **Human Skills:** Politics is about more than just data analysis. It requires empathy, understanding complex social dynamics, and the ability to build trust and relationships. AI lacks these crucial human skills.\n* **Ethical Considerations:** AI systems can be biased, and their decisions can have unintended consequences. Ethical considerations, transparency, and accountability are crucial for responsible AI use in politics.\n* **Public Trust:** People need to trust their elected officials. AI-driven decisions might raise concerns about transparency and accountability, potentially eroding public trust.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nAI is a powerful tool that can enhance political processes, but it's unlikely to completely replace politicians. The future of politics likely involves a collaboration between humans and AI, where AI assists in tasks and provides insights, while humans remain essential for ethical decision-making, empathy, and building trust.\n\n**Further Research:**\n\n* **The Future of Democracy in the Age of AI** by the Center", "constraints": ["Please also include the keywords \"research\" in the response", "The response must contain at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets", "Highlight at least 2 text sections, i.e. *highlighted section*"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [true, false, true], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["research"]}, {"num_placeholders": 3}, {"num_highlights": 2}]}

Add the diced tofu and stir-fry until it’s nicely golden brown and slightly crispy on all sides. Introduce the sliced cabbage, zucchini, and aubergine to the pan, continuing to stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp – they should still have a bit of bite, typically another 5-7 minutes. At this point, season with salt and pepper to taste, and add a splash of soy sauce for initial flavor. To create a glossy and balanced sauce, whisk together a tablespoon each of soy sauce and rice vinegar with a teaspoon of honey. Pour this sauce over the stir-fry and cook for another minute or two, allowing it to thicken slightly and coat all the ingredients.

", "response": "Let's explore the history of how we count years! \n\n**Section 1: The Ancient Roots**\n\nBefore the Western calendar, many cultures around the world used diverse systems to track time, reflecting their unique perspectives and needs. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Mayans developed their own sophisticated methods, often deeply connected to lunar cycles or the rhythms of agricultural seasons. These systems weren't standardized across regions, and the very concept of a \"year\" – its length and starting point – varied considerably depending on the culture and its priorities. Understanding these early systems reveals a fascinating tapestry of human attempts to impose order on the passage of time, offering a glimpse into our **historical** beginnings with timekeeping.\n\n**Section 2: The Roman Influence**\n\nThe Roman Empire played a significant role in shaping the way we count years today, building upon earlier traditions. The Romans, renowned for their meticulous record-keeping and administrative prowess, adopted a solar calendar based on the sun's annual cycle, a system they refined over time. This calendar, with its familiar 12 months and approximately 365 days, became the foundation for many later calendars used throughout Europe and beyond. The Romans also firmly established the concept of a \"year\" as a standardized unit of time, a crucial element for their complex legal and administrative systems, and for organizing their empire. This period represents a key moment in **historical** calendar development.\n\n**Section 3: The Western Calendar**\n\nThe adoption of the Gregorian calendar, the system we predominantly use today, is a relatively recent development in the long history of timekeeping. It was developed in the 16th century by Pope Gregory XIII to address accumulating inconsistencies in the Julian calendar, which had been in use for over 1600 years and was causing the date of Easter to drift. The Gregorian calendar, with its refined leap year system, quickly became the standard for much of the Western world, and its influence spread globally through trade, exploration, and the expansion of European culture and colonialism. The adoption of the Gregorian calendar marked a significant shift in how we understand and measure time, and it stands as a testament to the historical evolution of our understanding of timekeeping and its importance to societal organization.", "constraints": ["The number of sentences in your response should be at least 5", "Your answer should have 3 sections, and each section should start with \"Section X\"", "The word historical should appear at least 2 times in the song"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, true, false], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 5}, {"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 3}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "historical", "frequency": 2}]}

The `\\subfloat` environment from the `subfig` package is used to create subfigures for each logo, allowing for individual captions and labels.  `\\hfill` is used to create horizontal space between the images, providing the desired padding. The `[h!]` placement specifier attempts to place the figure \"here\" and overrides some restrictions if necessary.\n\nSection 4\nThe `width` argument in `\\includegraphics` is set to `0.45\\textwidth` for each logo.

This technology represents a significant advancement in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.\n\n***\n\nAt its core, a VRF system is a type of air conditioning system distinguished by its ability to utilize a single, outdoor condensing unit to serve multiple indoor units. This contrasts with traditional systems that typically require a separate outdoor unit for each indoor unit or zone.\n\n***\n\nThe versatility of VRF systems lies in their application across diverse building types and spaces. Indoor units can be strategically placed in various areas, including offices, classrooms, conference rooms, hotel guest rooms, and even individual rooms within a residential setting. This zoning capability is a key benefit.\n\n***\n\nThe operational principle centers around a central outdoor unit that efficiently circulates refrigerant – the substance responsible for heat transfer – to all connected indoor units. Crucially, the “Variable” in VRF refers to the system’s ability to precisely control the amount of refrigerant delivered.\n\n***\n\nThis variable refrigerant flow is the key to VRF’s efficiency. The system intelligently adjusts the refrigerant supplied to each indoor unit based on its specific and real-time cooling *or* heating demands.

When at one point does the question become trivial? (The train dilemma I'm referring to is the popular \"flip the switch to save 5 people but kill 1?\")Please reply in details, and include exactly 3 paragraphs. Separate the paragraphs with ***. Your answer must have a title contained in double angular brackets, such as <<title>>. Do not include any commas in your response. ", "response": "<<The Enduring Power of the Trolley Problem>>\n\nThe train dilemma at its surface a simple hypothetical rapidly descends into a complex exploration of ethical and philosophical principles. The foundational question – whether to sacrifice one life to save five – is a cornerstone thought experiment in moral reasoning directly engaging with utilitarianism deontology and the inherent value we place on individual human life. The power of the dilemma isn’t in the scenario itself but in its capacity to expose the tensions between these competing ethical frameworks. It forces consideration of whether consequences alone dictate morality or if certain actions are inherently wrong regardless of outcome. Furthermore the initial presentation deliberately lacks detail prompting reflection on how varying circumstances – the identities of those involved the agency of the decision-maker and the possibility of unforeseen consequences – might alter our intuitive responses.\n\nThe perception of the dilemma’s significance and whether it descends into triviality is profoundly subjective and rooted in an individual’s pre-existing moral compass. A staunch deontologist for example might deem the dilemma trivial in the sense that actively causing harm even to save others is always impermissible. Conversely a strict utilitarian might view the choice as trivially obvious – maximizing overall well-being necessitates saving the five. However to dismiss the dilemma as trivial overlooks its crucial function to illuminate the internal conflicts within our own moral reasoning. It isn’t about arriving at a “correct” answer but about meticulously examining *why* we feel a particular answer is right and acknowledging the ethical costs associated with any course of action. The value lies in the process of self-reflection not the conclusion.\n\nUltimately the enduring relevance of the train dilemma stems from its ability to serve as a microcosm of real-world ethical challenges. It encapsulates the fundamental tension between individual rights and the collective good the difficulty of predicting consequences and the inherent ambiguity that often characterizes moral decision-making. While some may find the hypothetical contrived it provides a safe space to grapple with these complexities fostering critical thinking and ethical sensitivity. Approaching the dilemma with intellectual humility – acknowledging the limitations of our own perspectives and a willingness to engage in reasoned discourse – is paramount. The goal isn’t to *solve* the dilemma but to use it as a catalyst for deeper understanding of our own values and the ethical landscape we navigate.", "constraints": ["Please reply in details, and include exactly 3 paragraphs.

", "response": "The language of Jesus is a fascinating topic, and its specifics remain a subject of scholarly debate. While the Gospels were written in Koine Greek, the prevailing consensus among many scholars is that Jesus most likely spoke Aramaic as his native tongue. Aramaic was the common vernacular language in the region of Judea and Galilee during the 1st century CE, and it’s highly probable that it was the language of everyday life for Jesus and his immediate community. The presence of Aramaic words and phrases within the New Testament texts – such as “Abba,” “Talitha Koum,” and “Maranatha” – serves as evidence of this linguistic connection, even though these are embedded within a Greek narrative. The choice to write the Gospels in Greek wasn’t necessarily indicative of Jesus’ own language proficiency, but rather a pragmatic decision to reach a wider audience within the Roman Empire where Greek was a *lingua franca*.\n\nAramaic itself is a Northwest Semitic language closely related to Hebrew and Arabic, historically spoken across the Levant – encompassing modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and parts of Iraq and Jordan. It wasn’t a single, monolithic language, but rather a spectrum of dialects. Jesus would have likely spoken a Galilean dialect of Aramaic, distinct from the Judean Aramaic spoken in Jerusalem. This language was deeply intertwined with Jewish culture and religious practice, and would have been the language of his upbringing, his prayers, and his initial teachings. The fact that the Gospels preserve fragments of Aramaic suggests that these original teachings, delivered in Aramaic, were considered significant enough to be retained even during translation into Greek.\n\nTherefore, while the Gospels are our primary source of information about Jesus, understanding their linguistic context is crucial. The Gospels weren’t simply translated *from* Aramaic, but rather represent a complex process of transmission, interpretation, and adaptation. The early Christian communities, largely composed of Jewish Christians initially, likely relied on oral traditions rooted in Aramaic before committing these stories and teachings to writing in Greek for a broader, increasingly Gentile audience. Recognizing this interplay between Aramaic and Greek allows for a more nuanced understanding of the historical Jesus and the development of the New Testament tradition.\n\nP.S. It’s also worth noting that Jesus likely had *some* proficiency in Greek, given the region’s increasing exposure to Hellenistic culture and the presence of Greek-speaking communities even within Galilee and Judea.

", "response": "pinpointing the absolute first American musical recording to feature a swear word is a surprisingly complex task. Early sound recording technology coincided with a period of strict societal and commercial censorship, meaning many instances likely went unrecorded or were edited out before release. Furthermore, the very definition of what constitutes a “swear word” is fluid and changes significantly across generations. Consequently, rather than a single definitive answer, we have a handful of contenders, each with varying degrees of documented evidence and historical context. It’s crucial to remember that record labels were highly sensitive to public perception and potential boycotts, leading to proactive self-censorship that obscures a complete historical record – a practice often dictated by executives at addresses like [Record Label HQ Address].\n\nAmong the frequently cited examples is a 1920s recording of George Gershwin’s “The Man I Love,” though attributing it specifically to the Boston Symphony Orchestra is inaccurate – various artists recorded the song during that era, including Fred Kelly. Some versions, particularly those featuring a vocal performance, allegedly contain the word “damn,” a term considered quite provocative for the time. Another prominent example is the 1927 recording of “The Blues” by the Chicago Blues Singers (often associated with Mamie Smith). This recording is reported to include the word “hell,” similarly shocking for audiences of the late 1920s. However, verifying these claims definitively is challenging due to the audio quality of early recordings and the potential for misinterpretation, often requiring restoration work done at facilities like [Audio Restoration Lab Name] located in [City, State].\n\nThe cultural context surrounding these early instances is vital. During the 1920s, music was largely viewed as polite entertainment, not the vehicle for social commentary or raw emotional expression it would later become. The use of profanity was considered deeply taboo, and its inclusion in a recording represented a significant breach of social norms. As the 20th century progressed, and particularly with the rise of rock and roll and subsequent genres, the boundaries of acceptable language in music gradually expanded. Today, swearing is commonplace, often employed for emphasis, authenticity, or to convey specific emotional weight, a stark contrast to the cautious environment of early American recordings.

", "response": "SECTION X\nLet's explore the fascinating question of whether *C. elegans* exhibits rudimentary consciousness. While *C. elegans* is a simple organism with a relatively small number of neurons – only 302 – it displays behaviors that prompt consideration of some level of sentience. For example it exhibits a remarkable ability to learn and remember and can respond to its environment in ways suggesting predictive processing a feature often linked to conscious experience. It’s important to acknowledge upfront that applying the term “consciousness” to such a simple system is fraught with difficulty and requires careful definition.\n\nSECTION X\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from its ability to navigate environments and learn associations. These creatures can learn the layout of a maze and then navigate it efficiently even after changes demonstrating a plasticity that hints at cognitive processing beyond simple reflex. This ability to learn and adapt suggests a level of information processing that is often considered a prerequisite for consciousness though it doesn’t definitively *prove* its presence. The mechanisms underlying this learning – how 302 neurons can encode and recall spatial information – are themselves a subject of intense study.\n\nSECTION X\nAnother aspect of *C. elegans* relevant to this discussion is its capacity for complex behaviors including responses to conspecifics and avoidance of pathogens. While interpreting these behaviors as indicative of a “sense of self” is highly speculative they contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting a richer internal life than previously assumed.

You can do this using the following code:\n\n```html\n<canvas id=\"mycanvas\"></canvas>\n```\n\nThen, you will need to create a JavaScript function that will handle the animation. This function will be called repeatedly to update the canvas with the next frame of your animation. \n\nHere is a basic example of how you could do this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction animate() {\n  // Clear the canvas\n  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n\n  // Draw the current frame of your animation here\n  // ...\n\n  // Request the next frame\n  requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n}\n\n// Set up the canvas\nconst canvas = document.getElementById('mycanvas');\nconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n```\n\nThis function will clear the canvas and then draw the current frame of your animation. It will then call itself again with `requestAnimationFrame` to create a smooth animation loop.\n\nYou can use any JavaScript library to help you create your animation. Some popular options include:\n\n* **p5.js:** https://p5js.org\n* **fabric.js:** https://fabricjs.com\n* **three.js:** https://threejs.org\n\nThese libraries provide a lot of tools and functions for creating animations, including drawing shapes, animating objects, and controlling the animation speed.\n\nOnce you have your animation created, you can display it on your page by using the canvas context to draw the animation data.

This encompasses the states of matter – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – and categorizes properties as either physical (color, density, melting/boiling points) or chemical (reactivity, flammability). Further, it distinguishes between elements, as pure substances of single atom types, and compounds, formed by the chemical combination of multiple elements, represented through chemical formulas like H₂O.\n\n***\n\nThe next core area focuses on atomic structure and the resulting chemical bonds. Atoms are comprised of protons, neutrons, and electrons, with the number of protons defining the atomic number and the sum of protons and neutrons determining the mass number (clarifying the distinction from average atomic mass). The arrangement of electrons is described by electron configuration. These atomic properties dictate how atoms interact, leading to different types of chemical bonding: ionic bonding through electron transfer, covalent bonding via electron sharing, and metallic bonding involving electron delocalization within a metal lattice.\n\n***\n\nFinally, the concept map addresses chemical reactions and their quantitative aspects. Chemical equations symbolically represent reactions, identifying reactants and products while adhering to the law of conservation of mass. Stoichiometry delves into the quantitative relationships within these reactions, utilizing concepts like molar mass and the mole as a unit of amount.

Pinpointing exact timelines and identifying clear demarcations between these waves is challenging due to incomplete historical records from earlier periods. Moreover, the very definition of “advanced civilization” is subjective; criteria for assessment vary, making cross-era comparisons problematic. What one era values as advancement – perhaps agricultural prowess – might differ greatly from another’s focus on technological innovation.\n\nDespite the lack of concrete evidence for multiple, wholly distinct civilizations, the cyclical nature of human history is undeniable. The recurring rise and fall of empires, the continuous development of new technologies, and the constant evolution of human societies all point to a pattern of progress and, at times, regression.

", "response": "<<Reasons for Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor>>\n\n**Response 1: A Strategic Preemptive Strike Fueled by Expansionism**\n\nJapan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was a complex, calculated decision stemming from a confluence of long-term strategic goals and immediate pressures. Key reasons include:\n\n* **Expansionist Policy & the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere:** Japan aimed to establish dominance in East Asia and the Pacific, envisioning a self-sufficient “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The US was perceived as the primary impediment to realizing this vision, particularly as it concerned potential **alliance** building against Japanese interests.\n* **Critical Resource Needs:** Japan lacked essential resources like oil, rubber, and metals vital for its industrial and military growth. Securing access to resources in Southeast Asia was paramount, and the US posed a threat to that access.\n* **Perceived Threat of US Economic Warfare:** The US had imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions on Japan, including an oil embargo, in response to Japanese aggression in China. Japan viewed these sanctions as an act of war and a deliberate attempt to strangle its economy.\n* **Anticipation of US Intervention:** Japan anticipated eventual US intervention in their expansionist endeavors, particularly in Indochina. A preemptive strike against the US Pacific Fleet was intended to neutralize American naval power, granting Japan time to consolidate its gains and prevent the formation of a strong opposing **alliance**.\n* **Failed Negotiations:** Prolonged diplomatic negotiations with the US failed to produce a resolution acceptable to Japan. The US insisted on Japan withdrawing from China, a condition Japan was unwilling to meet, fearing it would leave them vulnerable to Soviet and potential Western **alliance** pressures.\n\n**Response 2: A Risky Gamble to Secure Regional Hegemony**\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor represented a high-stakes gamble by Japan, predicated on a belief in its military capabilities and a miscalculation of the US response.\n\n* **Belief in Naval Superiority:** Japanese naval strategists believed their fleet, particularly their carrier-based air power, was superior to the US Pacific Fleet. They aimed for a decisive, crippling blow.\n* **Desperation Due to Economic Blockade:** The US oil embargo and other economic sanctions were severely impacting Japan’s war machine and economy. The attack was seen as a desperate attempt to break the blockade and secure vital resources.\n* **Underestimation of US Industrial Capacity & Resolve", "constraints": ["Offer two different responses and separate them with 6 asterisk symbols \"******\"", "Avoid using the word alliance", "The entire reply should contain a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>", "containing keywords \"alliance\" in your response"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, true, false, false], "kwargs": [{}, {"forbidden_words": ["alliance"]}, {}, {"keywords": ["alliance"]}]}

It’s crucial to remember avalanches are unpredictable, and no single element guarantees safety. A comprehensive assessment involves analyzing the snowpack, terrain, and current weather conditions, alongside understanding the impact of human activity. Recognizing that conditions are dynamic and can change rapidly is paramount for safe backcountry travel.\n\n***\n\nThe snowpack’s stability is fundamental. Look for indicators like recent snowfall amounts, distinct layering, and the presence of weak layers within the snow structure. Newly fallen snow that hasn’t consolidated can create these weak layers, increasing susceptibility to failure. Density and consistency are also key; a dense, cohesive snowpack generally exhibits greater stability than a loose, powdery one. Terrain features significantly influence risk as well. Steeper slopes are inherently more prone to avalanches, and slopes with southern or western aspects receive more solar radiation, potentially leading to warming and instability. A slope’s past avalanche activity is a critical indicator – a history of slides suggests a higher likelihood of future events.\n\n***\n\nFinally, weather conditions – including wind, temperature, and precipitation – all contribute to avalanche risk. Strong winds can form wind slabs, unstable layers prone to fracturing. Cold temperatures can compact snow, while warmer temperatures can weaken it. Heavy precipitation adds weight, increasing the overall avalanche hazard. Staying informed about current conditions is vital, as risk is constantly evolving. Always consult avalanche forecasts and reports before entering avalanche terrain, and be prepared for the possibility of an avalanche despite precautions.", "constraints": ["Answer shoud be written in English, with all letters lowercased.", "There should be exactly 3 paragraphs in your response, separated by the markdown divider: ***.", "Your answer must contain exactly 3 bullet points in the markdown format (use \"* \" to indicate each bullet) such as:\n* This is the first point.\n* This is the second point"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [true, false, true], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_paragraphs": 2}, {"num_bullets": 3}]}

This **REMARKABLE** creature, with its vibrant plumage and fiery breath, has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, challenging our understanding of avian evolution and igniting debates about the potential for fire-breathing birds.\n\n**Section 2: Unveiling the Emberbird**\n\nThe Emberbird, scientifically classified as *Pyrrhocorax ignis*, was first spotted by a team of researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. The team, led by Dr. Amelia Ramirez, spent months tracking the elusive bird, finally capturing footage of it in its natural habitat. The bird's most striking feature is its plumage, a vibrant mix of orange, red, and yellow, which seems to glow in the dim rainforest light. \n\n**Section 3: The Fire-Breathing Mystery**\n\nThe Emberbird's most remarkable characteristic is its ability to breathe fire. The researchers observed the bird puffing out a plume of intense heat from its beak, which they believe is used for defense and communication. The exact mechanism behind this ability remains a mystery, but scientists are exploring various hypotheses, ranging from specialized respiratory organs to a unique adaptation of the bird's digestive system. This is a **TRULY** baffling phenomenon.\n\n**Section 4: Ecological Implications**\n\nThe discovery of the Emberbird has raised questions about its impact on the rainforest ecosystem. Some experts believe the bird's fire breath could have a significant impact on the local flora and fauna, potentially creating new habitats and influencing the behavior of other species. Others are concerned about the potential for the Emberbird's fire breath to be used for hunting or territorial defense, potentially leading to ecological imbalances. The potential consequences are **ASTOUNDING**.\n\n**Section 5: A New Era of Avian Evolution**\n\nThe discovery of the Emberbird has opened up a new chapter in the study of avian evolution. The bird's unique ability to breathe fire challenges our understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped birds over millions of years. Scientists are eager to learn more about the Emberbird's biology, behavior, and potential evolutionary significance.\n\n**P.S.** It is important to note that the scientific community is still in the early stages of understanding the Emberbird and its unique abilities.

Some common techniques include:\n\n* **ARIMA Models:** ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models are statistical models used to analyze and forecast time series data. They can be used to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data. By comparing the actual data to the predicted values, deviations from the expected pattern can be flagged as anomalies.\n* **Z-Score Analysis:** Z-score analysis is a statistical method that measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Data points with a Z-score exceeding a certain threshold are considered anomalies.\n* **Detection of Seasonality:** Seasonality is a periodicity in time series data that occurs at regular intervals. Techniques like moving averages, Seasonal ARIMA, and STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) can be used to identify and remove seasonal patterns, making it easier to detect anomalies.\n* **Extreme Value Analysis:** Extreme value analysis is used to identify data points that are outliers. These outliers can be detected using various methods, including the percentile method, the Z-score method, and the robust cuckoo filter method.\n* **Spline Models:** Splines are piecewise polynomial functions that can be used to model the trend and seasonality in time series data. By comparing the actual data to the fitted spline model, deviations can be identified as anomalies.\n\n**Relevant Scientific Publications:**\n\n* **\"Time Series Analysis and Forecasting\" by David A. Anderson**\n* **\"An Introduction to Time Series Analysis\" by John A. Rice**\n* **\"Statistical Methods for Time Series Analysis\" by Robert J.

", "response": "Section 1: The Problem\nThe core challenge is to place bishops on an N-by-N chessboard in a way that prevents any two bishops from attacking each other. This is a classic chess problem often referred to as the \"bishop placement problem.\" The goal is to maximize the number of bishops placed without any two threatening one another. This is a **FUNDAMENTAL** problem in combinatorial game theory.\n\nSection 2: Defining \"Non-Threatening\"\nA configuration of bishops is considered \"non-threatening\" if no bishop can attack any other bishop on the board. This means no two bishops share the same diagonal. A bishop attacks along diagonals, so any two bishops on the same diagonal constitute a threat. It's **CRUCIAL** to understand this definition.\n\nSection 3: A Common Solution Approach\nA common approach to solving this problem involves placing bishops to create a pattern that avoids shared diagonals. This often results in a structure that appears diagonal or diagonal-like, though other patterns are possible. The key is to ensure no two bishops lie on the same diagonal. This requires **CAREFUL** planning.\n\nSection 4: Reasoning Behind the Solution\nThe effectiveness of this approach stems from the nature of bishop movement:\n\n* **Diagonal Movement:** Bishops move exclusively along diagonals. Therefore, avoiding shared diagonals is paramount.\n* **Preventing Attacks:** By carefully selecting positions, we ensure no bishop can directly attack another.\n* **Strategic Considerations:** While maximizing the number of bishops is the primary goal, strategic placement can be considered in more complex scenarios, though it doesn't fundamentally change the core principle of avoiding diagonal conflicts. This is **ESSENTIAL** for larger boards.\n\nSection 5: Limitations and Maximum Placement\nThe maximum number of bishops that can be placed on an N-by-N chessboard without them threatening each other is limited by the size of the board (N). Specifically, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 2N - 2. It's important to note that while this provides the maximum, there isn't necessarily a *single* optimal arrangement; multiple configurations can achieve this maximum. The best arrangement may depend on specific constraints or desired patterns.

Overgrazing, deforestation, and climate change are putting immense pressure on our planet's resources. Furthermore, ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare and the environmental impact of traditional livestock farming are increasingly influencing consumer choices. This presents a critical opportunity for the beef industry to embrace a more sustainable and ethical future. Artificial beef manufacturing offers a viable solution, providing a market-driven alternative that addresses these concerns while meeting the growing demand for beef.\n\n**SECTION 2: The Promise of Artificial Beef**\n\nArtificial beef, also known as cultivated meat or lab-grown meat, is produced by cultivating animal cells in a controlled laboratory environment. This process eliminates the need for traditional animal agriculture, significantly reducing the environmental footprint and ethical concerns associated with conventional beef production.\n\n* <<Environmental Advantages>> Artificial beef production requires significantly less land, water, and energy compared to traditional beef farming. It also eliminates greenhouse gas emissions associated with livestock, contributing to a more sustainable food system.\n* <<Ethical Considerations>> By eliminating the need for animal slaughter, artificial beef production eliminates the ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare and promotes a more humane food system.\n* <<Potential Health Improvements>> Artificial beef can be produced with a higher nutritional profile, potentially offering a healthier alternative to traditional beef.\n\n**SECTION 3: Market Potential and Consumer Acceptance**\n\nThe market for alternative protein sources is rapidly expanding, with consumers increasingly seeking sustainable and ethical food options. Artificial beef has the potential to capture a significant portion of this growing market.\n\n* <<Rising Consumer Interest>> Consumer demand for plant-based and alternative protein sources is on the rise, driven by concerns about environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and health.\n* <<Market Growth Prospects>> The artificial beef market is poised for significant growth, with major players like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods already demonstrating consumer acceptance and market success.\n* <<Competitive Branding Opportunities>> Artificial beef can be marketed as a premium, sustainable, and ethical alternative to traditional beef, allowing companies to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.\n\n**SECTION 4: Technological Advancements and Scalability**\n\nArtificial beef production technology is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in cell culture and bioreactor development.

It’s a common problem in 3D graphics and can be visually distracting, especially with dynamic or transparent elements.\n\nmove the vertices of your ImmediateGeometry closer to the camera, or conversely, move the camera further away from the geometry. Adjusting vertex positions directly within the node’s properties is one approach. A more robust solution involves scripting; you can calculate offsets based on the camera’s position and direction, dynamically adjusting the geometry’s placement to maintain a safe distance from other objects. This ensures consistent rendering regardless of camera movement.\n\nBeyond positional adjustments, consider material settings and rendering order.

", "response": "Alright, let's dive into the glorious, cheese-filled past, shall we? You want to know about the tech involved in ancient cheesemaking? Buckle up, buttercup, because it's about to get cheesy.\n\n***\n\n**1. Origins and Early Vessels: The Dawn of Dairy Tech**\n\nCheesemaking wasn’t born from complex machinery, but from necessity and observation. The earliest evidence suggests cheesemaking arose shortly after the domestication of animals – around 8000 BCE! The “technology” at this stage wasn’t about tools, but understanding. Early cheesemakers likely discovered cheese accidentally, noticing milk stored in animal stomachs (containing rennet) would separate into curds and whey during travel. Initial “vessels” were likely animal stomachs themselves, followed by woven baskets lined with leaves, and eventually, pottery. These weren’t designed *for* cheese, but adapted to the purpose.\n\n***\n\n**2. Milk Sources and Quality Control – A Natural Approach**\n\nThe foundation of any cheese is, of course, milk. Ancient cheesemakers utilized milk from a variety of animals – cows, goats, sheep were common, and in some regions, even buffalo, camels, or reindeer. Crucially, they lacked pasteurization. This meant milk quality was paramount. They relied on healthy animals, careful observation of animal diets, and likely seasonal variations in milk composition. Milk was often used immediately after milking, and knowledge of how different milks yielded different results was passed down through generations. They understood, intuitively, the impact of milk source on the final product.\n\n***\n\n**3. Coagulation: Rennet and Beyond**\n\nThe core of cheesemaking – coagulation – was achieved primarily through rennet. This enzyme, sourced from the stomachs of young ruminant animals (kids, lambs, calves), was a vital, though not always easily obtained, ingredient. However, rennet wasn’t the *only* method. Fig sap, certain plant extracts, and even acidic substances like lemon juice or vinegar were used to acidify the milk and induce curdling. The choice of coagulant impacted the texture and flavor of the resulting cheese, demonstrating a level of sophisticated experimentation.\n\n***\n\n**4. Shaping, Salting, and the Art of Aging**\n\nOnce curds formed, the process moved to shaping and preservation. Ancient cheesemakers employed simple tools: hands, woven mats, perforated baskets, and animal skins. These were used to drain the whey and", "constraints": ["Please finish your answer with a postscript starting with P.P.S", "Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***", "the total number of words in your response should be at least 18"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [true, false, true], "kwargs": [{"postscript_marker": "P.P.S"}, {"num_paragraphs": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 18}]}

", "response": "The provided Java code snippet contains several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly. The most immediate problem lies within the attempted string replacement using `name.replace(\"$NAME$\", name)`. The `replace()` method in Java does not modify the original string; instead, it *returns* a new string with the replacements made. The original code doesn't assign this returned value back to the `name` variable, meaning the replacement is lost. This results in the original string being unchanged.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the code is missing a crucial semicolon at the end of the intended return statement, `return name`. This is a fundamental syntax error in Java, and the compiler will flag it. Without the semicolon, the code will not compile. Additionally, the initial assignment `name = \"Hello $NAME$ how are you doing?\";` appears redundant if the goal is to substitute a value for `$NAME$`, as it overwrites any potentially existing value in `name` with this placeholder string.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nVariable `name` itself is not declared or initialized before being used. In Java, all variables must be declared with a specific data type (in this case, likely `String`) before they can be assigned a value or used in operations. Without a declaration like `String name;`, the compiler will not recognize `name` as a valid identifier. This omission is a significant error that must be addressed for the code to compile and execute.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nTo rectify these issues, the code needs to first declare the `name` variable, then assign the placeholder string to it. Subsequently, the `replace()` method should be used correctly by assigning the *result* of the replacement back to the `name` variable. Finally, a properly terminated return statement, `return name;`, is essential to return the modified string from the function or method containing this code.

A simple example is a dollar buying less candy over time: prices rise, and consequently, your dollar diminishes in value. More formally, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services, meaning that more money is required to purchase the same items.\n\nOften, inflation stems from an increase in the money supply that outpaces the availability of goods and services. This dynamic can be illustrated with an example like concert tickets – high demand coupled with limited supply leads to higher prices. When there’s more money chasing a fixed amount of goods, prices rise as consumers compete for those goods. Sellers respond by raising prices, capitalizing on consumers’ willingness to pay.\n\nConsider a popular toy: surging demand combined with relatively constant production inevitably leads to a climbing price. This scenario mirrors the broader economic phenomenon of inflation – increased demand, limited supply, and rising prices. This effect isn’t isolated; for example, high housing demand exceeding the rate of new construction drives up housing prices.\n\nInflation has both potential benefits and drawbacks. High inflation strains household budgets and can negatively impact businesses. However, moderate inflation can sometimes stimulate economic growth.

", "response": "SECTION 1: Introduction to GraphQL Regex Identification\nA regular expression can be used to identify GraphQL queries or mutations, though it's important to understand its limitations. A basic pattern to achieve this is `(?i)(?:query|mutation)[\\s\\S]*?`. The `(?i)` flag is crucial as it ensures case-insensitivity, allowing the regex to match \"query\", \"Query\", \"QUERY\", etc.\n\nSECTION 2: Breakdown of the Core Pattern\nThe heart of the pattern is `[\\s\\S]*?`. This component is designed to match *any* character, including whitespace (`\\s`) and non-whitespace characters (`\\S`), effectively capturing everything between the \"query\" or \"mutation\" keyword and the end of the GraphQL operation. The `*?` quantifier is vital; it makes the match non-greedy. Without the `?`, the regex would attempt to match as much as possible, potentially spanning multiple GraphQL operations.\n\nSECTION 3: Targeting Specific Operation Types\nTo isolate mutations specifically, you can replace \"query\" in the original pattern with \"mutation\": `(?i)mutation[\\s\\S]*?`. Conversely, to target only queries, use `(?i)query[\\s\\S]*?`. These variations allow for focused extraction of either query or mutation blocks.\n\nSECTION 4: Limitations and Alternatives\nWhile this regex approach offers a quick solution, it's not foolproof. GraphQL documents can contain nested structures, comments, and other complexities that a simple regular expression struggles to handle correctly. For robust and reliable parsing of GraphQL, especially in production environments, utilizing a dedicated GraphQL parser is highly recommended. These parsers are designed to understand the GraphQL language specification and provide accurate and complete results.", "constraints": ["In your entire response make sure to use exactly 4 bullet points in markdown format.

Achieving sustainable success in this field is exceptionally difficult, stemming from a complex interplay of factors that extend beyond simply possessing artistic talent. The romanticized image of the successful artist often clashes sharply with the practical realities of navigating a competitive and often unforgiving landscape. This isn’t a matter of lacking skill, but rather a systemic challenge requiring resilience, adaptability, and a keen understanding of the business side of art.\n\nA primary contributor to these difficulties is the intensified competition brought about by the digital revolution. While democratization of art creation tools is positive in many respects, it has simultaneously led to a dramatically saturated market. The ease with which anyone can now produce and distribute artwork means that standing out requires more than just proficiency; it demands a unique voice, consistent branding, and effective self-promotion. Compounding this is the art world’s inherent trend-driven nature. Artists are frequently compelled to adapt their styles and skillsets to align with current tastes, a process that necessitates ongoing investment in learning new techniques, acquiring updated software, and potentially even rebranding – all of which represent substantial financial and time commitments.\n\nFurthermore, the financial precarity faced by many artists is a critical issue. Relying solely on art sales for income is often unsustainable, leading to inconsistent earnings and the constant need to balance creative pursuits with other employment. Beyond basic living expenses, artists incur significant costs related to materials, digital tools, studio space (if applicable), and crucially, marketing and online presence development. Building a professional website, utilizing social media effectively, and potentially engaging in paid advertising are all essential for visibility, yet represent further financial burdens.

For centuries, light was considered unaffected by gravitational forces due to its lack of mass. However, modern physics, specifically Einstein’s theory of general relativity, demonstrates otherwise. More information about the history of this discovery can be found on reputable physics websites.\n\n***Einstein's Revolution: Spacetime and Gravity***\nEinstein's theory of general relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity. It posits that gravity isn't a force pulling objects together, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Imagine a bowling ball placed on a stretched rubber sheet – it creates a dip. This dip represents the curvature of spacetime.\n\n***Light's Interaction with Spacetime***\nLight, despite being massless, follows the curves in spacetime. It always travels in a straight line, but that \"straight line\" is defined by the geometry of spacetime itself. Therefore, when light travels through a gravitational field – near a massive object like a star or black hole – its path is bent. This isn’t because the mass is “pulling” on the light, but because spacetime is curved. Researchers at observatories like the Event Horizon Telescope continue to study this phenomenon.\n\n***Gravitational Lensing: Observing the Effect***\nThis bending of light is known as gravitational lensing. The amount of bending is directly proportional to the strength of the gravitational field; a stronger field causes more significant deflection. This effect can manifest in several ways, from subtle distortions of distant objects to the creation of multiple images of the same source.\n\n***Experimental Confirmation and Significance***\nThe effect of gravity on light has been observed and confirmed through numerous experiments. Landmark confirmations include observations of the bending of starlight around the sun during solar eclipses and the observation of the gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by intervening massive objects. Einstein's theory of general relativity remains a cornerstone of modern physics, profoundly impacting our understanding of cosmology, astrophysics, and the universe as a whole. \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?", "constraints": ["Put the response into at least 5 sections, separated using 3 asterisks ***", "Don't forget to include the keywords Einstein's", "Please include at least 2 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]", "In your response please avoid using commas", "The very end of your response should read \"Is there anything else I can help with?\""], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, true, false, false, false], "kwargs": [{"num_paragraphs": 3}, {"keywords": ["Einstein's"]}, {"num_placeholders": 2}, {}, {"end_phrase": "Is there anything else I can help with?"}]}

They often update their structure, making it difficult for scripts to reliably find elements. Selenium, while powerful, can struggle with these changes.  \n\n**Strategies for Layout Change Detection and Resistance**\n\n1. **Element Identification Strategies:**\n\n   * **CSS Selectors:** Use CSS selectors to target elements based on their unique attributes. These are generally faster and more readable than XPath.\n   * **XPath:** XPath is a powerful tool for locating elements based on their position and relationships within the HTML structure. Use it when CSS selectors are insufficient, but be aware of potential performance impacts.\n   * **Regular Expressions:** Regex can be used to find elements based on patterns in their HTML, but this is generally discouraged as it's brittle and prone to breaking with even minor HTML changes.\n\n2. **Layout Change Detection:**\n\n   * **Element Presence:** Use Selenium's `find_element` method (within a `try...except` block) to check if an element exists. If a `NoSuchElementException` is raised, you'll know a layout change *might* have occurred.\n   * **Element Visibility:** Use `element.is_displayed()` to check if an element is visible. A change in visibility can indicate a layout shift. However, be mindful of elements that are dynamically hidden/shown.\n   * **Element Size:** Compare the dimensions of an element to its previous size. A significant change in size might signal a layout change. This requires storing previous dimensions.\n   * **Page Source Analysis:** You can analyze the HTML source code of the page to detect changes in the structure. This is a more complex approach, potentially involving comparing hashes of the page source. Consider storing a baseline page source at [baseline_page_source_location] for comparison. This is **CRITICAL** for long-term stability.\n\n3. **Implementing a Robust Script:**\n\n   * **Explicit Waits:**  Instead of `time.sleep()`, use `WebDriverWait` with `expected_conditions` (EC). This makes your script wait *only* until the element is found or a timeout is reached, improving efficiency.\n   * **Error Handling:** Handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`, `TimeoutException`). If an element is not found, try alternative selectors, implement a retry mechanism, or log the", "constraints": ["The very end of your entire response should read exactly like: Hope you agree with me.

He’s curious, observant, and consistently willing to challenge the status quo, a trait vital for personal growth. To embody this trait, one can cultivate a mindset of constant questioning, actively seeking to understand *why* things are the way they are. This involves challenging assumptions, exploring different perspectives, and being open to new ideas through reading widely, engaging in diverse conversations, and actively seeking out viewpoints that differ from your own. It’s about recognizing that your current understanding is *a* understanding, not *the* understanding, and remaining receptive to evolving your beliefs – a judicious approach to knowledge.\n\n**SECTION 2: Resilience**\n\nNeo faces constant setbacks and threats throughout the film, yet he is not deterred by pain, fear, or the overwhelming odds stacked against him. He perseveres, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges, demonstrating a powerful inner strength. To cultivate resilience, practice self-compassion, acknowledging your struggles and setbacks without allowing them to define your self-worth. Embrace the process of learning and growing from your mistakes, remembering that setbacks are often opportunities for growth in disguise. Building a strong support network is also key, as Neo relies heavily on Trinity and Morpheus for guidance and encouragement. Judging yourself too harshly hinders this process.\n\n**SECTION 3: Intuition**\n\nNeo's intuition consistently guides him towards the truth, providing a strong sense of knowing that something is fundamentally not right with his reality. He trusts his gut instincts, even when they seem illogical or defy conventional explanation, and this trust proves essential. To develop intuition, prioritize paying attention to your inner voice and learning to discern its subtle messages. Practice mindfulness and meditation to quiet the noise of the external world and connect with your inner wisdom, allowing intuitive insights to surface more readily. Don't dismiss gut feelings as mere whims; instead, journaling can help identify patterns in your intuitive responses and build confidence in your inner guidance. It’s a journey of self-discovery, requiring judicious self-reflection.\n\n**SECTION 4: Adaptability**\n\nBeyond resilience, Neo demonstrates remarkable adaptability, a skill that allows him to thrive in the ever-changing environment of the Matrix.

The porosity of this material – which refers to the presence of pores or voids within the structure – is a **CRUCIAL** factor in its applications. The porosity of crosslinked polystyrene can be controlled during its synthesis through several key factors.\n\nSECTION 1: CROSSLINKING AGENT\n\nThe choice of crosslinking agent plays a significant role in determining the porosity of the final product. Different crosslinking agents have varying degrees of reactivity and ability to form crosslinks between polystyrene chains. The type and concentration of the crosslinking agent directly influence the density and connectivity of the polymer network. This is **ABSOLUTELY** key to controlling the final material.\n\nSECTION 2: CROSSLINKING CONDITIONS\n\nThe conditions under which the crosslinking reaction occurs also impact the porosity. Factors such as temperature, reaction time, and the presence of catalysts can all affect the degree of crosslinking and, consequently, the pore size and distribution. Higher temperatures generally lead to faster crosslinking rates, potentially resulting in a more tightly packed network with smaller pores. Careful control is **ESSENTIAL** here.\n\nSECTION 3: SOLVENT SYSTEM\n\nThe solvent used during the synthesis can also influence the porosity. The solvent can affect the solubility of the polystyrene and the accessibility of the reaction sites. A solvent with high polarity can lead to a more uniform pore size distribution, while a solvent with low polarity can result in a more heterogeneous pore structure.\n\nSECTION 4: MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND POLYMERIZATION CONDITIONS\n\nThe molecular weight of the polystyrene also plays a role in determining the porosity. Higher molecular weight polymers tend to have larger pores due to the increased chain entanglement. The polymerization conditions, such as the initiator and the reaction temperature, can also affect the molecular weight and, consequently, the pore size and distribution. Understanding these relationships is **PARAMOUNT** for successful synthesis.", "constraints": ["Do not contain commas in your response", "Make sure to include at least 4 sections marking the beginning of each section with 'SECTION X'", "Wrap the entire response with double quotation marks", "Use some words in all caps in your response, but those all-caps words should appear at least 4 times"], "follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false, true, true, false], "kwargs": [{}, {"section_spliter": "SECTION", "num_sections": 4}, {}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 4}]}

It fundamentally rejects all forms of hierarchy and coercion – encompassing not only government but also private property and wage labor. The envisioned society centers on free association, where individuals cooperate to fulfill needs, sharing resources and power through mutual consent.\n\n**Section II: Achieving Equality**\n\nEquality within anarcho-communism is intrinsically linked to its abolition of hierarchy. The core tenet is the distribution of power and resources based on need, rather than arbitrary factors like birth, wealth, or social standing. This implies universal participation in decision-making and contribution to the community according to individual abilities and desires, freeing individuals from the constraints of hierarchical control.\n\n**Section III: Challenges and Criticisms**\n\nDespite its egalitarian aims, anarcho-communism confronts substantial challenges. A primary criticism centers on the potential for chaos and conflict arising from the absence of centralized authority. Further concerns exist regarding the mechanisms for ensuring equitable resource distribution and preventing exploitation without a formal legal framework or enforcement structure.\n\n**Section IV: Assessing its Egalitarian Potential**\n\nDetermining whether anarcho-communism represents the “most equal” political ideology is inherently difficult. Equality is a multifaceted concept, subject to varying interpretations across different societies.

The strengths lie in the consistent use of \"Aethelgard\" to ground the story and the varied approaches to highlighting both the mechanical and fantastical elements. Several titles like \"The Iron Scales of Aethelgard\" and \"The Shadow of the Iron Wyrm\" successfully blend imagery of traditional dragon lore with the unique mechanical twist. The inclusion of words like \"Chronicle\" \"Tale\" and \"Fantasy\" also subtly signal the genre and potential scope of the narrative. However a few titles lean towards being overly descriptive (\"The Mechanical Dragons of Aethelgard\") rather than evocative potentially lacking the intrigue to immediately capture a reader's attention.\n\nTo further refine these titles consider the overall *feeling* the story aims to convey. Titles like \"Wyrmforged Fury\" and \"Aethelgard's Last Stand\" promise high-octane action while \"The Whispers of the Iron Wyrm\" suggests a more subtle suspenseful narrative. The contrast between \"The Gears of Doom\" and \"The Wyrm's Engine\" is also interesting one implies destruction the other a complex perhaps even symbiotic relationship. The final title \"The Iron Heart of Aethelgard A Fantasy of Hope\" feels slightly out of step with the generally ominous tone established by the others – unless the story *specifically* focuses on resilience and overcoming adversity it might benefit from a more ambiguous or foreboding feel. It's important to ensure the title accurately reflects the core themes and emotional arc of the story.\n\nUltimately the \"best\" title will depend on the specific narrative. However based on a balance of evocative imagery genre signaling and intrigue titles like \"The Iron Scales of Aethelgard\" \"The Shadow of the Iron Wyrm\" and \"The Whispers of the Iron Wyrm\" stand out as particularly strong contenders.

", "response": "<<Running Large Language Models on Average Computers>>\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) – such as GPT-3, Llama 2, and others – represent a significant leap in artificial intelligence. However, their complexity is substantial. Training and deploying these models demands vast datasets and immense computational resources. The scale of these models, frequently measured in billions or even trillions of parameters, presents a major hurdle: fitting them onto standard personal computers is often impractical. This is due to memory limitations and processing power requirements.\n\n***\n\nThe Rise of Smaller, Accessible Models\n\nDespite the challenges, significant progress is being made in enabling the use of LLMs on more readily available hardware. Advancements in model compression and optimization techniques are key. These techniques focus on creating smaller, more efficient versions of LLMs. While these smaller models may not match the performance of their larger counterparts in all tasks, they can still deliver impressive and useful capabilities for a variety of applications. The trade-off between size and performance is a central consideration.\n\n***\n\nHardware Requirements and Considerations\n\nEffectively running *any* large language model requires careful consideration of hardware. A powerful computer is essential, and a dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is highly beneficial – often crucial for reasonable performance. GPUs excel at parallel processing, which is fundamental to the matrix multiplications and other complex calculations inherent in LLM operation. However, some highly optimized, smaller models *can* function on a CPU, though execution will be considerably slower. RAM capacity is also a critical factor, as the model needs to be loaded into memory.\n\n***\n\nSoftware Tools and Optimization Strategies\n\nSpecialized software libraries and frameworks are indispensable for working with LLMs. Popular choices include TensorFlow and PyTorch, providing comprehensive tools for model building, training, and deployment. Beyond these frameworks, specific optimization techniques are vital. Quantization reduces the precision of the model's weights, decreasing memory usage. Pruning removes less important connections within the network, further reducing size. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, more efficient one. These methods collectively shrink the model's footprint.\n\n***\n\nThe Future Landscape of LLM Accessibility\n\nCurrently, running state-of-the-art LLMs on average computers remains a significant challenge. However, the field is evolving at a rapid pace. Ongoing innovations in both hardware (more powerful and affordable GPUs, specialized AI accelerators) and software (more efficient algorithms, improved compression techniques) are continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible.", "constraints": ["Your answer must end with the exact phrase \"Let me know if you have additional questions.\".

Here's a breakdown of the process, keeping in mind that AGI is a complex and evolving field, and we're still in the early stages of research and development.\n\n***\n\n**Understanding the Core Concept: Defining Artificial General Intelligence**\n\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical type of intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to a human. It's not just about being good at specific tasks like playing chess or writing code, but about having the capacity to learn and adapt to new situations and solve problems in a general sense. Crucially, AGI implies a level of cognitive flexibility and common sense reasoning currently absent in even the most advanced AI systems. The benchmark isn’t simply *performance* on a task, but the *ability to learn* to perform new tasks without significant re-engineering. This is **ABSOLUTELY** key.\n\n***\n\n**The Power and Limitations of Language Models as Building Blocks**\n\nLanguage models are a powerful tool in the pursuit of AGI. They are trained on massive amounts of text data, learning to understand and generate human language with impressive accuracy. These models, like large language models (LLMs), can perform tasks such as:\n\n    * **Understanding Natural Language:** They can analyze text, identify entities, and extract meaning.\n    * **Generating Text:** They can write stories, translate languages, summarize documents, and even compose music.\n    * **Reasoning and Problem Solving:** They can use their language understanding to solve logical problems, make predictions, and even engage in basic reasoning.\n\nHowever, it’s vital to acknowledge their limitations. Current language models are primarily pattern-matching engines; they excel at *imitating* intelligence but often lack true understanding, common sense, and the ability to generalize beyond their training data. They are prone to “hallucinations” – generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information – and can be easily misled by adversarial inputs. This is a **MAJOR** challenge.\n\n***\n\n**Integrating Language Models: Key Architectural Considerations for AGI Prototypes**\n\nTo create a prototype of AGI, we need to go beyond simply using language models for specific tasks. We need to integrate them into a system that allows them to learn, reason, and adapt in a more sophisticated way.

Listing even numbers from 1 to 100 is irrelevant to a general probabilistic argument and isn't a valid method for determining the probability.\n\nThe correct approach involves considering the possible scenarios: the product of two integers is even if at least one of the integers is even. It’s easier to calculate the probability of the complement – that the product is odd (which happens only if both integers are odd). If we assume each integer has a 50% chance of being even or odd, the probability of both being odd is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
